        "message": "I absolutely loved this game for months, ever since it first came out. Can‚Äôt stop playing it everyday nonstop. Was getting every challenge, ever high score and ranking needed. I was having a blast with it. AND THEN you finally make multiplayer mode an option after having it on screen for months but could never play it AND ITS HORRIBLE. So many issues i don‚Äôt know where to begin. First of all, I can‚Äôt even get pass class F because I‚Äôm coming in last place after the million glitches, everyone is already done with lap 2. Anytime someone is near me, the game freaks out and just makes me crash and all other players pass me. There is WAY TOO MANY BUGS in multiplayer to even have any fun with this mode, it‚Äôs ridiculous. I haven‚Äôt even tried to play with a friend because I know something will go wrong and it won‚Äôt be fair to anyone. And finally the worst part is, I HAVE TO PLAY MULTIPLAYER MODEü§¨ If there weren‚Äôt any challenges dedicated strictly to multiplayer mode then I would have no issue with it and completely ignore it until it was fixed. But for me to excel in the game and get the stars and everything I need and want, I HAVE TO PLAY IT. It‚Äôs completely unfair and hope this is resolved before I stop spending my money on this game every week or so. I never complain or write reviews but I had to say something because I‚Äôve loved this game this it began and now it‚Äôs having a huge issue to me. Hope someone reads this and can agree with me.
