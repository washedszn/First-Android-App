        "message": "I wanted to say can‚Äôt we just have more friends not max friends? I was thinking like just 300 not 200 because anytime someone friends me, it doesn‚Äôt work because I have ‚Äúmax FRIENDS‚Äù it annoys me so much. This game is really fun but I have a question, are you sure your protecting us? Because, I think your not really protecting us from old people like online daters that dress like 12, 15, 14, etc. and some of them are buying robux and wasting their money. I can‚Äôt really explain but, I will just say what I can say. Some old mans go in roblox like social media‚Äôs they create their account like all other social media‚Äôs and then the old mans Online date they ask for phone number, face, feet, and body words that are inappropriate. AND Your pretty much not protecting us from then you know why? Because you all care about... ‚Äú$üí¥Müí∂Oüí∑Nüí∞Eüí∏Yüíµ$üí¥$‚Äù. Also, reports don‚Äôt work. I wonder why, did you even work hard on it? Probably not. But PLEASE make reports work, I don‚Äôt like getting bullied, scammed, or have online daters in my fricken server, like BRUH. Too disgusting, but kinda funny to me. That‚Äôs all I wanted to say. Oh and there‚Äôs a person you banned that I think came back made a game that‚Äôs for online daters it‚Äôs called ‚Äú[Content Deleted]‚Äù. Also, there‚Äôs some words you forgot to tag out, ‚ÄúChienne‚Äù and ‚ÄúQueue‚Äù chienne is the B word in English, and queue means a boys private in English. Thank you for listening, and have a good night/good day.",

        "message": "Overall I do think this game is pretty good, just a couple things could be better.  One thing that I‚Äôve been having trouble with, is that on certain games while playing on mobile, it doesn‚Äôt let you join.  It just kicks you out of the game. I wish that didn‚Äôt really happen because there are a lot of people that only have access to a mobile device to play this game, so I feel that should be fixed so people have a bigger variety of games. Another thing is, GLITCHING. It happens so much on games!! I know it‚Äôs hard to fix but just on any device there are certain glitches on games that can make people cheat and like some people call it ‚Äúbreak the game.‚Äù The lagging is another thing I think the game creators should decrease the amount of players that are allowed in the game.  In my case, that is what is causing most of the lag. The final thing I would like to change is the way you get robux. A lot of people can‚Äôt afford to buy it or are not allowed to. You can do so many different things with robux and people without it are feeling left out or jealous of other people. I think you should be able to earn robux by doing certain thing or completing a task in a game for free. I think it‚Äôs just more fair that way. But if you want to buy extra robux or something THAT could cost money, but overall it should be free.  I do really like this game and it is so entertaining and fun. I love the fact that you can play with your friends and make new ones!! üòÉüòÉ\nThanks! üôÇ‚úåüèª",

        "message": "You should definitely download this game and today I will tell you why? I have been playing this game for two years now with my friends on discord and it‚Äôs has been an amazing adventure! One of my favorites parts about roblox is that you have many games to choose from and my personal favorites are sacrifice sanctuary and jail break and much more scary games because I love horror stuff. But if your a girly girl don‚Äôt worry there is also bloxburg and meepcity but royal high is most likely the best for girly girls if you are one, so there is many different games you can choose from infact there is over one million games! Roblox is a free game but robux is not you have to buy robux it‚Äôs not no expensive. In 2016 they did this thing were you can make your own game on builders club but sadly no more builders club but there is now roblox premium and if you buy it you can make your own games and get robux monthly. You don‚Äôt have to get robux because you can still play the games without it. You can mostly buy robux with customs clothes and game passes and some games. There is only one problem about roblox there is trollers exploiters and even hackers but don‚Äôt worry if you see an exploiter or troller report them and roblox will warn them ban them or even account delete them but if you see a hacker leave the game right away and roblox will find that hacker and ban them. But over all roblox is the best game yasssss!",

The first problem is that you can randomly get kicked out of your account and not be able to log in. There is a reason for the verification for the email thing in settings but please still fix this. Second, the new premium update. I have bought the 4.99 a month subscription but it was cancelled and it disintegrated give me my monthly allowance. I was sad because I literally wasted money on you and you just scam me with your broken promises. Please fix that too and give me my premium back. Third, please get rid of all the scam games. There are kids wasting their energy on ROBLOX just trying to get robux and then all of a sudden, they lose their account. These kids put work into their account. Starting over will make you feel like you failed everything. Fourth, get rid of hackers. They are dangerous and look like they are superior, they can take over everything and steal your account. Again, kids put work into these games and would cry to find out it was a waste of time. Nobody wants a kid to cry unless you‚Äôre messed up. Fifth, well, there is no fifth. This game is really boring and have really bad games. The games that are actually good don‚Äôt update much and give new experiences. More people trying to spread their work on making games should play ROBLOX and help make it more interesting and fun. Please try to fix all of these. I‚Äôm trying not to quit ROBLOX.",

        "message": "Roblox is a great game, but over all it does need some changes. If your looking for a game you can say numbers with out them turning into tags, this is not the game for you! For ex. 1=# one=### also you can not cuss or do anything badly on this game or it turns into #### but of you are going to get this insanely amazing game, I recommend the following games: Welcome to Bloxburg, Adopt Me!, Flee the Facility, royal high,Bakon, and Piggy, these games are great, the only games I think the gender boy will not like is Royal High. It is a game where you collect skirts, wings, accessories, and much more girly items! Adopt me is where you can collect adorable pets and adopt kids! Bloxburg is a game where you work for money buy a car, pay bills, and build a house! Flee the Facility is a game where 1 of the 5 players turn into a beast. The beasts goal is to get the survivors into a tube and freeze them. The survivors have to hack computers to let the exits lock unlock and then you have to open it. Bakon is a game where someone turns into a roblox bacon hair and tries to get the other players to die. The other players have to get items to escape. Piggy is pretty much the same as Bakon except the Bacon is now a Pig. Hope you enjoyed reading this boring review and hope you enjoy the new game on your device! (Also roblox if you‚Äôre reading this can you make it where you can at least say ten? Or one? Or you get what I mean lol)",

        "message": "I think roblox is  a good game it‚Äôs so nice you have over a million games to choose from! It‚Äôs like having a milling board games except online!\n\nI think roblox is the BEST and when I say BEST I mean the BEST! Only 2 issues though. 1.When you report someone the creators or whoever is supposed to look at them,they don‚Äôt look at the reports. 2.When you are on a role play game people REFUSE to read the rules they think that the world revolves around them and they can do whatever they want! I really think that you should have a thing in roleplays that if someone breaks a rule the game kicks them out. It‚Äôs not fair for other people that they have to follow the rules but some people don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not saying roblox is a bad game by saying this i just think about that it should be upgraded! It‚Äôs a really good game after all!  \n\nI really like how you can search a game and if you accidentally spell it wrong it searches for somthing close to it and pops it up and tells you what it searched up! I also like the fact that you can see the ratings on the games,it makes it cooler so if the ratings are bad then you shouldn‚Äôt play them but if they are good you should play them! I just think roblox is a good game! I didn‚Äôt know people read this so I never really wrote a comment before but whenever I saw some of the ratings people wrote a lot so I had to try it out! I hope y‚Äôall enjoyed reading my rating! Bye! üëãüèª",

        "message": "So I overall like this game! It‚Äôs incredibly fun and there is a lot of options for you to play on. Like for example, you can play Royal high, then the next second your playing Viking simulator! I do think there is some annoying things in Roblox. Like if you are playing a game and someone swears( they also try to make that not happen but somehow, people find a way!) you can always hit the report thing, right? Yeah, that doesn‚Äôt work. They say that the creators of the game( yes, you can create games!) are supposed to read the report and ‚Äúfix‚Äù the problem. Well, sorry to tell you but that doesn‚Äôt happen, sadly. Also you can make friends in the game but I don‚Äôt really do that a lot because they might be scammers or online daters. Also, if I you give them to much information then they could seriously hack your account and if you have robux, steal your money! Speaking of robux, I think that robux is stupid. You have to pay for it and they make you start out with zero. Also, robux is the way that you can buy gears on the game and different hairs and clothes. Now to what I like about the game. I love how people are able to create games that people can actually play! If you create a game, a you-tuber can play your game! Also, you can play compete every games, simulator games, obbys, and more! I hope you enjoyed my review and have a great day! Always know that your amazing!",

        "message": "Roblox is a great platform for playing different games in one app but also making them. It allows you to communicate with your friends, join them in severs etc. I have used Roblox on many devices and the price of Robux is fairly reasonable according to things you can receive. \n\nYou might be wondering why I‚Äôm saying so many great things but I‚Äôm only giving this 4 stars. The main reason behind this is EVERYTHING is censored. By everything, I mean my UwU. Even as you can chat, you can‚Äôt UwU, which is a large portion of my human existence. Another reason is I‚Äôve been hacked out of my account many times (5 times to be exact) and I‚Äôm not the type of person to fall for some scams. I don‚Äôt play roblox as much as I used to and don‚Äôt spend a large amount of money so I haven‚Äôt been hacked out of my account. I shall assume the problem with the many hackers has been fixed due to no one I know getting hacked in a long time. Another thing is I have lost robux, it has only happened once though. I think it was some sort of glitch so it wasn‚Äôt too much of a big deal since it was a small amount.\n\nAll in all, I think if you are thinking of getting roblox, just get it. I would highly recommend it for just playing games rather than talking to friends due to the highly sensitive chat. It has been mostly enjoyable and there‚Äôs normally updates in games every holiday or it sometimes is monthly, which I must add, is very very quick.",

Its weird knowing someone you don't really know. Maybe their just friending you so they can stalk you! 2: Games are pretty fun, but it's the glitching! Some games don't allow you to play because your GLITCHING! You take sooooo slow to load, and you go sooooo slow when you walk! 3: When theres no connection... If you have no connection, you can't even join the game! If that happens to you, you're not alone. Many people can't join games because of the INTERNET. If that happens, please find a way to fix it. Or it will even get WORSE. 4: Nothing much, but games. Games, really! Some games aren't apparently appropriate to other young kids! But, they still play them! They might learn bad ways to treat other people! Eventually, they WILL treat others that way! 5: Hackers! Hackers! Hackers! Hackers! What wrong with hackers? They can get your account, and hack it! Deleting everything you have! You might end up with nothing, and you looking like a NOOB! 6: Robux! If you want robux, you have to BUY! Don't go on other websites that give you FREE ROBUX! Honestly, It might make you do a verify to get the FREE  ROBUX! I know, I know, just please don't judge me. But these problems are MY opinion, but still is Roblox's problems too.

I‚Äôve met a group of people who are now my best friends. And it was all because of this game. I‚Äôm even in contact with them from different social media‚Äôs! Thank you Roblox for this awesome content. But here is one thing that reallyyy bugs me. Safechat! I personally think you should remove it. It‚Äôs really hard to see what my friends say. In most games I play, for example, Bloxburg! It‚Äôs a really fun and enjoying game for people to play, but whenever me and my friends talk in that game, it‚Äôs really hard for me to understand what they same. Especially in any game! It makes me kind of mad but playing Roblox has made me really happy. I love how you can even creat your own games, t-shirts and etc. But before I end this review, there is one thing I have to complain about. Scammers! You know how people get robin and buy it with there money? Well in a few groups scammers are spamming random links to hack into people‚Äôs accounts, and it‚Äôs really annoying. Usually it happens in games too. From what I think, they create random accounts and paste something like ‚ÄúJoin (link) to get free ROBUX now! It‚Äôs only up for a limited time.‚Äù I just find it really unusual and dumb. But overall this game is great! Can‚Äôt wait to see how it revolves in the future.",

        "message": "I love ROBLOX. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs a great game. You can make friends, chat with people, customize your avatar (by paying real money), etc. It‚Äôs a really fun game that gets more and more popular. BUT, I have some issues. \n1. Robux. Every person that plays ROBLOX wants some robux. No one wants to look like someone else‚Äôs avatar because they couldn‚Äôt get robux. No one wants to search the internet and try to find ways to get free robux. (Cmon guys, we all know we did it.) I think that certain prices of things in the shop should be changed. For example, hair should not be 80 robux (a lot of hair is 80 robux.) ..instead, maybe it should be 45 or 50 robux. Other things in the shop are the same way. OVERPRICED. I also think that when you make a ROBLOX account you should get some robux to start with. Not much, just a small amount. Like 20 robux. Just so that no one really feels bad about not having robux- or the money to pay for it. It also prevents things like hacking other accounts for robux and stuff like that.\n\n2. Scams and inappropriate things. I‚Äôve been scammed multiple times in ROBLOX. I know there‚Äôs not much you can do, but I (and many other people) have gotten scammed for things we paid real money for. In games like meep city, adopt me, etc. Also, I know ROBLOX is really working on this.. but there are a lot of inappropriate games with nudity and cuss words.\nThanks for reading this long speech!

It is certainly not fair that some people can not afford robux or are not allowed to . And some of us that don‚Äôt have robux are very jealous that others do . They feel left out and ask people , they even beg , :( . And sometime they get rejected . I don‚Äôt have robux because I‚Äôm not allowed to. So this is one of the things that I ask to change 2 SCAMMING mostly everyone knows about the famous game called Adopt Me . Yes it is a very fun game but you guys have to do something about it.   Some people that don‚Äôt have the robux , like me , work hard for the pets in that game . And people just o and scams you . 3 the GLITCHES i have a very serious problem with those and it really gets annoying . It kicks you out of the whole app and makes you restart . 4 HACKERS you guys have to find a way to find those hackers and do something about it . My old account , potatoinheavens, got hacked . Why ? Because there is games that say that they will give you robux . If you just enter your password to identify that it‚Äôs you and that you aren‚Äôt a robot . 5 you guys don‚Äôt do a THING when we report a person for doing something wrong. Well that‚Äôs it for my opinion about the game . It is a very fun game ! No hate at all :)! I just ask to fix that . But this game is awesome especially because we can play with friends!",

After you‚Äôve put the reason, you have a CHOICE to make a description, once you‚Äôve submitted, an admin will check in the servers and see what there doing. Even if you get banned, they have a reason for it, for example, you have a group and you posted something inappropriate so they give you a warning, if you continue, you will get banned, depending on how bad the picture is, is how long you could be banned.

Because, if people report this person and they don‚Äôt even get kicked or get a warning that they‚Äôll be kicked if they keep on doing it, it‚Äôs just wrong! Also, when younger kids see this they might think it‚Äôs cool and all, but what they don‚Äôt realize is that it‚Äôs actually wrong to swear, online date, etc!

It takes forever to get them and it really annoys me how much robux I spend. Also sometimes the game is laggy but that is typical for an awesome game like this. I‚Äôm also a little mad because it is almost a copy of Minecraft the original block game. Yes I love this game but it makes me mad with the money spent on it. When you go join the game you start as something called a noob, if you are a girl you have red hair and normally grey or paper white skin. It is annoying how you have to buy clothes. Even if it is 5 robux which costs around 99 cents. I love this game so much but it needs improvement! I will continue to pay for things and probably never delete it.

Like snapchat and discord, I allow notifications. That‚Äôs how I would want it please? It‚Äôs just a suggestion, I hope you can reply to me about it. It would be a pleasure for me and make my day, if you can‚Äôt make notifications when someone chats me, or something, it‚Äôs okay as I said it‚Äôs just a suggestion! Also, I see some of things I have said before were not tags, but have become tagged- and were not inappropriate at all, they were harmless. Please don‚Äôt tag almost everything out, it‚Äôs literally hard to communicate and chat with others in game and or chat. In my opinion, roblox has gotten better for younger audiences- but kind of cringe for older audiences. But roblox is a gg, ngl. I played it a lot, it‚Äôs just the school work that I have to deal with if you know what I mean. I would give this 4 stars and a half of a star (almost a 5 star because of some lag and the toxic people). Thank you for your time. :)",

Now for typing even tho you censored boyfriend and girlfriend people are still dating they say b friend and g friend so you should do something about that and people are saying the h word. But I at least think you should be able to say you and people's names like what If your playing with your friend from school and there name is Taylor when you say it I gets TAGED OUT and what if your playing with your cousin Jacque when you type it it gets what do you know TAGED OUT and numbers you should be able to say numbers look I clearly think that's ridiculous that you can't say 1 and 2 and 3 and 24 and ya know what I mean right?

        "message": "Roblox is fun to play, recently the app has been updated and I‚Äôm sure that I‚Äôm not the only one with these problems. First I thought maybe it was just a simple bug because I started noticing when I go to users profile to try and follow them on my mobile app it just won‚Äôt let me click it. I found this so annoying because in order to follow people I would have to get my laptop out and do it that way. Now another update has been out mind you this issue before still isn‚Äôt fixed. With the new update I liked the look but the functionality of it is still not up to par. Before the update it was super simple to go to the catalog and purchase items for my avatar. Nowww it‚Äôs so much of a hassle just to scroll down the catalog on mobile as soon as I scroll down some and try to keep scrolling it automatically scrolls back up to the very top making it impossible to find something worth buying. Please roblox if you are going to come out with so many updates you could at least fix the previous issues. All these problems are making me slowly want to not play roblox anymore. And I‚Äôve spent lots of money on this game. So please fix these issues for us. It‚Äôs so very annoying. There‚Äôs too many bugs, stop worrying about the look of roblox and fix these issues. I‚Äôd much rather be happy with the older version of roblox from some months ago. At least it was much more simple to navigate and didn‚Äôt have so many issues. üòê",

I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying a couple dollars for this game (because it‚Äôs a genuinely good game) but to actually get decent outfits and perks you better have a steady paycheck.   The game also decided to remove the armory (which tells you the stats of each gun)\n\nAnd then there‚Äôs the glitches.  Sometimes the hit boxes are off, and the grass clips through the car floor.  Other times you can get stuck between objects, etc.  the spectating button (the one in the main lobby) doesn‚Äôt work.  It always says there are too many people spectating when in reality no one is watching.  The one thing that makes me mad is my friend ‚ÄúMCS-Ghost‚Äù was banned from the system for 10 years after his iPad rebooted mid game.  The system recognized this as irregular and claimed it violated the ‚Äúterms and agreement‚Äù.  I know for a fact that he didn‚Äôt do anything remotely wrong, because I‚Äôve been playing with him almost every week for 2 years.  Never again will we be able to talk about our lives while mowing down squads by our ‚Äúlucky spot‚Äù.  It‚Äôs time we moved to greener pastures, whether that‚Äôs Apex Legends or Rocket League.  If you are considering downloading this game, I would do so, just understand that if you have an unreliable device, it‚Äôll probably be flagged by the system.",

I have been playing since it came out and no problems what so ever except the fact that hackers have found a way to take advantage! Its not fair because people are actually trying to rank and others are hacking to rank up too. People are putting money into this game and what so we can get screwed once in a while by one person shooting through a wall? Naah its not fair but really what do you do when we report them?? Anyways sometimes when i lay down my player stands back up which got me killed sometimes. Some cars drive silly, they slide or they dont even want to drive normal also sometimes people dont die when i hit them on a legit speed to kill them it just makes that one noise. The bots are cool because free kills and free loot but once i was in a middle of a battle and a bot was shooting me from behind like what the? Or they give our position away quick because we're killing it or theyre shooting maybe we should not have bots and hackers? The game would be a 5 star and will make more money$$ also you should add the new maps pleasee i know miramar is a new one but it would be nice!!! Im a decent player and i know its not my fault next update u should fix those issues and add that new map please we will enjoy very much! Overall the game is always going to be my favorite battle royale game! Thank you!",

Thirdly, this isn‚Äôt about bugs but something most player complaint about, PLEASE do remove fragments from 120 UC crates and also remove temporary skins and add permanent gun skins/skins from the Offer Value walls to purchase. I almost recently just purchased a skin and 60 UC for $2 but then I saw that the skin was only a 7 day temporary, just stating a fact, no one will every buy those Offers unless their outta their mind. And also I know you prob won‚Äôt change this one, but make people have a higher chance of getting a legendary or even epic skins in 120 UC crates. This shouldn‚Äôt be a pay to look cool game, especially with you devs adding more skins instead of fixing bugs. Thanks",

        "message": "This game recently through loading screens and circle placement has been encouraging hardcamping. If you don‚Äôt know hard camping is when the majority of a players game consists of stagnantly waiting and in PUBG case... this works.\nSadly there is no counter measure in most scenarios, the best you can do is get lucky with circle and nearby cover but for the most part this is out of the question. Most of the time the outcome looks like this... the circle is closing and you see a group in front of you which you proceed to fire upon, but the nearby building has a group of campers waiting patiently for someone to cross their path. Know you may be thinking ‚Äúwell you have guns fire back from cover‚Äù but that‚Äôs not the case. Most of all cover is given from grass and trees which the grass provides 0 cover unless the enemy is stupid ( yes even with a gillie suit) and trees run far and few so any movement to fire back leads to being knocked and if you wait the storm kills you eventually. Also smoke doesn‚Äôt provide perfect cover and in almost all cases your smoke wound provide enough room to get to more cover so basically no matter what gun you have, no matter how good you are, no matter how good they are, you will be killed in this scenario. Please fix this pubg create wider smoke screens or provide more cover",

I deleted it because I died wayyyyy too many times from bugs like vehicles exploding for no reason, parachutes not opening causing me to fall to my death, de-sync issues that allow people to kill me after I‚Äôve already been shooting at them, etc. first game back on and I‚Äôm crouching behind a crate that I was looting, guy sees me and shoots me twice so I move. I can literally see him (third person view) on the other side of the crate about 50 meters away. He continues to shoot at the crate while I first aid myself. Now, still crouched behind a metal crate with ZERO of my body exposed, he continues shooting at the crate and kills me through solid metal. Yeah, true story. Why was I crouching behind a metal crate?

It is very hard to land at a location far away from the airplane. And if you do manage to make it, the safe zone is always too far away, and now you die in the storm because the map is too big and the matches are too long. \n    Which brings me to the 3rd reason, and ways PUBG could improve their game. The matches are too long, so when you play a game, and you are about 20minutes in, and you die, you don‚Äôt play anymore, you go to another app. So if you decreased the amount of time in the match, you will have more people playing the game, and more often too. I can‚Äôt stress enough how important it is to keep the matches short, when you win a game, it typically takes about 25-35mins to do so. So if you take this down to about 10minutes per match, most people will have the time to play more, plus you could play 3 rounds in the time it takes to play one. \n    So in conclusion, if you are going to improve the game in some major ways, this is the route to go.",

This can give your position away and can get you killed. I only have one other problem with this game, and that‚Äôs trying to get the app fully loaded. I have an iPhone 6, and it can take up to ten tries to get the app running. A lot of the time the game will freeze on the tencent logo and not go anywhere. Sometimes the game will just crash mid-load. The checking updates and loading screens can also freeze and crash the game. Strangely, once in the game it runs very well. It‚Äôs just the loading into the app is difficult. This is what led to the four star review.",

        "message": "I‚Äôm in a weird period in my life where I don‚Äôt get to play games as much as I use to. Growing up, I spent countless hours in front of the TV with my PlayStation playing the greats like Final Fantasy to pulling all nighters and skipping school for midnight releases for games like Halo 3. Nowadays I‚Äôm lucking to have two hours to myself to sit down, thinking the purchase of a Nintendo switch would be the answer to all my questions, I invested but soon found out that outside of Zelda, I had a hard time forming a habit to play it. Over the years I found mobile games to have a little more meat to them with classics like Final Fantasy getting ports and gems like Transistor playing wonderful on iOS, that I‚Äôm more so leaning to these whenever I feel an itch to play a game especially when I'm at arms reach of an iPhone or an iPad. I enjoy FPS and love to play matches online, thanks to the Halo days and Fortnight and Pubg are great games but the lack of controller support for this really stinks. so though I enjoy Pubg a lot more and I‚Äôm fine with touch screen games, having controller support goes along way. Playing Final Fantasy and Transistor with a MFi controller made the quality of the game better. For this reason, Ive downloaded Fortnite and deleted Pubg. Hopefully this will change someday.",

        "message": "Okay so first off let me just say that this is a great game! I know people say that the controls are horrible, but you honestly just have to get used to them. For a mobile game the graphics are actually pretty nice to look at. There are many other great qualities about the game but let cut to the chase, BUGS. I‚Äôve been playing Fortnite for a while and it‚Äôs been awesome, but up until recently there are these to really messed up bugs that have cost me countless games. 1. Is the bug were you can‚Äôt interact with anything, chests, llamas, ammo boxes, loot drops everything. To fix this you need to go to settings and toggle the ‚Äúhold to interact‚Äù button on or off. This isn‚Äôt that bad but I have been in scenarios where I‚Äôm busy trying to change my settings to interact with something and I just get sniped. 2. Isn‚Äôt really a bug but still, LAG. I‚Äôve had times when I can move my character but can‚Äôt look up, down, left, or right. And it happens a lot of times in my games. At first I thought it was the iPad I play on. But I play on a less than a year old iPad Pro, so that‚Äôs not the problem. My WiFi is good and i don‚Äôt have cellular data on my iPad. And it only started happening when the birthday celebration was added. Like I said I love Fortnite, but these bugs and lag are making the game not as enjoyable. Please fix these issues!",

If epic games is reading this then can you please improve the game and Improve Errors that happen for unknown reason. As well as it says Shields give you extra health, but It‚Äôs useless in the storm So If you can either Vault the storm or make it to where Shield can help you in the storm. Another thing is that in Season 8 My pickaxe can‚Äôt break through structure like trees, rocks, and houses. For me to break those I have to shoot it with a gun with wasted my ammo I really hope you can fix this glitch. I would also like to say in Season 8 if I step on something I hear a sizzling noise and it takes off 1% of my health, I don‚Äôt know why it does this. My theory is it‚Äôs because of the earthquake or volcano. But it‚Äôs very annoying for me because I lost a game because of it.

But mobile needs to have replays because we cant show off our good games also it needs to be compatible with fortnite master because i cant show off my great KD and the only way to show my wins is to screenshot and then send then delete the screen shot and after a while it gets really annoying. But all in all it is a great game and if you are a new player you should really try to teach yourself how to play claw because it helped my gameplay ALOT and i got sooo many kills and wins after i did because not many people have the dedication to do something like that.

        "message": "Fortnite is a video game sensation. Every child has heard or played the game, and when I heard a Mobil version was going to be released I was ecstatic. When Fortnite Mobil finally came, I signed up and played. Eventually I got pretty good. But with the season five update came several ruining blows. First off, the game has gotten super slow. I have an iPhone seven with 5g on and it runs choppy. And when it does occasionally work well, you get killed by a new player who can‚Äôt even move. This is because of the auto fire. I think it should be removed immediately. It allows the game to shoot for players giving the an insane advantage over a person who enjoys the old way of shooting. This new auto shooting allows anyone with no skill to get 20 kills by just running around. If you get in a sniper battle, you can‚Äôt peak because you will die immediately. And if you accidentally run into someone who has a hunting rifle out your dead. Auto fire is bad. And finally, when playing with the tap anywhere it just doesn‚Äôt shoot or build or jump sometimes. It might be a glitch but I can‚Äôt even play the game because each of the modes for shooting are trash. The auto fire wastes amo. The tap anywhere doesn‚Äôt build or shoot, and the button shoot is two sensitive or it doesn‚Äôt register. So there. Why this app currently gets two stars. I love this game but it pains me to see Epic ruin it.",

The only problem I hated which I know, phones and tablets can‚Äôt stand PC to Console Graphics which maybe some people are use to, but for me, I‚Äôve been getting lag and my game has been freezing as soon as I‚Äôm in a battle which completely stinks for us mobile players. Can you please fix this Epic Games and I hope your working on it. Also one more problem which kinda affects only new people or inexperienced people on Mobile which is inputting both Switch and Mobile players together. I would always do so well but now us Mobile players are with almost-tryhard Switch players which kinda ruined the game for most Mobile players or it could just be me being bad. Anyways, the game is pretty good but the two problems are something I want you guys (Epic Games) to fix.\n\nAnother problem is for the whole entire Fortnite community meaning all platforms of the game. This problem is the removal of Pump Shotguns. I don‚Äôt understand why you vaulted them but they are more balanced then the Tactical Shotgun. Maybe you should have vaulted the Tactical Shotgun instead because it seems that more people are complaining about it than the Pump. Overall like I said, the game is pretty good but please unvault the Pump and vault the Tactical Shotgun.",

        "message": "Overall let me just say I love this game and everything about it. But I‚Äôve come up with this new technique and I want to share it with Epic Games.\n\nI call the strategy ‚Äústealing‚Äù but you can call it something else. First, in a match with teammates, the basics. You get eliminated, and your reboot card pops up. I want the reboot card to be visible and interactive to the opponent and his teammates. After the reboot card gets picked up by the opponent, each teammate of the eliminated player will get a tracker pad. If their inventory is full, they will have to switch out their current Gun/med. Holding this tracker pad, will send a signal to the opponent to be warned. I forgot to mention that the opponent can not reboot the player, and the only way to get the reboot card back is to eliminate the exact opponent who took it. After the tracker pad signals the opponent, the tracker pad, (only by holding it) will show a reboot card signal on top of the opponent who has the reboot card. After that, the teammate can go towards the opponent with the reboot card. Then, after eliminating the opponent with the reboot card, the teammate can successfully claim the reboot card and reboot the player. That‚Äôs all that I can think of on my list. Thank you, Epic Games, for creating this wonderful game, Fortnite.",

Also please make champions league players not be a able to get in a game with lower tier players so us champs league players can get some good practice. And please just vault the drum gun and add back tac smg no one really uses the drum gun anymore, also please vault the semi auto sniper and add back the hunting rifle the semi is so useless especially with the heavy and bolt sniper in the game there is no point in having the semi auto sniper the hunting rifle was a lot better and a lot more fun to use like going for trick shots. Also vault the burst smg there is no point in using it when you could use the suppressed smg so it‚Äôs just a waste of a spot in the loot pool and also please vault airstrikes and add back bouncers, bouncers are great for rotations and it would make competitive Fortnite better for those late game rotations. Those were some of my suggestions overall love the game but would like to see some changes keep the weekly updates coming in they keep the game feeling fresh keep up the good worküêê‚ù§Ô∏è",

All of the game is wonderful but I would really like to see IPhone‚Äôs Force Touch to be added. I would like for you to be able to force touch the screen to shoot because every iPhone that can run this game has force touch. One game for instance that uses this function is Pixel Gun 3D. You can press hard on the screen to fire and it makes the game so much more enjoyable and less chaotic for your fingers. Also I would really like the ability to move your buttons around to how I would like. That functionality would make this game so much easier to play. The last thing I would like to see is definitely controller support. There are many mobile controllers that would make this game, being it mobile, so much more fun. Since we can play with console players, and since this will more than likely be released for the switch, controller support would make this perfect for on-the-go fun. It is very hard to play with just the screen when you have to battle people with controllers. Please consider this because everyone would enjoy these additions.

The only thing that is giving me a little frustration is that when you run out of lives you have to wait for half an hour. Like, I will have all 5 lives and I get to a level and don‚Äôt get it the first time. I now have 4 lives. I think,‚ÄùJust get it next time!‚Äù I don‚Äôt get it again and now have 3 lives. Then 2 then 1 then 0. Now I have to wait half an hour just for 1 life. Just to end up having to wait another half an hour. I was wandering if it is not too much trouble if maybe instead of having to wait half an hour for 1 life, you could just watch an ad. Other than that, you also have to pay money if you want more stuff that you can‚Äôt get with your gold bars. I am a kid, and can not spend money. (For me it is just a game and should not have to spend money on it, also I am just not allowed to spend money on this) So maybe if it is not a big problem bring down the prices for stuff you can get with gold bars. I am hoping I am not starting any problems. Please at least do something about the lives. Other than that this is my favorite game (and only game) that I have.\nP.S\nI was on level 306 and on some of the candies were like rainbows and after a little bit they were a different candy.

As I do with every phone game I get bored of them and either dont play for a while or just delete the game entirely. I picked up the game again for the first time a few weeks ago and I‚Äôve been playing constantly. The one thing that is driving me crazy are the pop ups between levels. I do not remember their being so many. There are so many of them that it takes almost as much time to click claim or ok on all of them as it takes to clear some levels. I just want to play my level then get on to the next one. Having to click sweet and ok 7 or 8 times on occasion is just infuriating imo. But thats just my opinion. Other than that its a great game. They of course want you to buy gold but you don't have to if you don‚Äôt want. I also like how they don‚Äôt constantly shove the ‚Äúbuy me‚Äù button every second.

Additionally, why does the game take my black balls WITHOUT a stripe or candy bomb nearby?? That‚Äôs CHEATING!! Then the hard, harder, hardest levels come so close together, that there‚Äôs little opportunity to move ahead in the race once reaching the 2,000 levels. While the competition is ok, it seems that you‚Äôve forgotten that SOME ADULTS play the game to relax & as a pass time. It should‚Äôve cause frustration because you‚Äôre trying to force players to make booster purchases. We‚Äôre adults, not kids wanting to spend countless hours trying to get through one level of a game. Our lives consist of more than time on a game.

Just enough strategy needed to keep me hooked and just enough opportunity to take some harmless revenge out on siblings and cousins who I am not around enough to pick on like I can with repeated attacks and raids. Love ya sis but you better not let your guard down!! For the developers -Please, please, please - find a way to minimize the number of pop up screens!!  Their repetitive nature is only motivating to keep the app closed, not purchase a package. I hate to run out of spins, not because they are gone but because the punishment is between two and six pop ups every single time. That‚Äôs overkill on the marketing. I will happily read through a screen of messages once daily and am fully aware of all the options for buying, earning or sharing more spins. You are beating a dead horse and it‚Äôs gonna be what ultimately will lose my business. My other favorite game keeps a screen available of all that pertinent information available at all times on a list in an INBOX. It doesn‚Äôt require me close a hundred screens a day to get to the fun part. It‚Äôs a much preferable option. Thanks",

You would think that after a purchase of a pack or whatever, you would have less or no ads at all? Nope, ads just continue and get worse in frequency to the point that it isn‚Äôt even fun because I‚Äôm closing ads more than playing. 1hr wait for 5 spins is a little ridiculous, maybe like 30minutes but an hour is way too long. Contests seem to be rigged or something because a contest can like JUST start and two or three players will be well over the any rational number, like 200+. However even with over 500 spins, doing 3 or 5x per spin, I may get three or five of the Thor Hammer/helmet or whatever is the required prize to get the contests stuff so how others have enough spins to get well over like 1000, even betting more than 5 spins is ridiculous. On top of it, it seems that it is rigged because during non-tournament things, I get a massive amount of attacks with little addition of more spins/raids/etc. however, like the tournament that is on now, some guy has like 10k+ emeralds and no matter what I spin, I‚Äôm not getting any attacks? I had 1000 spins from the last tournament and out of that 1000 spins, I got five attacks. I was doing the 5x bet through the whole thing too!

I loved this game when I first started playing! But as I progressed I realized that the game is rigged to be a cash cow for the developers. I will try to keep this short, although I have many things I‚Äôd like to say. 5 spins an hour? Absolutely rediculous.. Gold cards? Try trading them. Literally impossible unless they unlock two, that‚Äôs right, two cards to be traded. This only happens once a weekend, or even every other weekend. Out of spins and have some extra real money to throw at them? Don‚Äôt worry, the slot machine becomes even more rigged when you were playing with the spins the game provides. The reels will be sure to literally land on the same 5 things and you‚Äôll maybe receive one ‚Äúraid‚Äù, ‚Äúattack‚Äù, or any other objective in the game. Also, if you have a complaint about something that has happened in the game, for instance, I had thousands of spins disappear one day when I multitasked to another application, they will not provide any response, compensation, explanation, or even a breath in your direction.",

How do expect us to choose your options of 10x20x30x40x50 x100x200 with 60 spins?

I'll breakdown the spam here: Load game- get attacked with 2 event pop ups and a package pop up. While playing, your screen may get a random ad out of nowhere you'll need to close (4 pop ups so far). Now while doing your spins if you dare increase bet past 1 and your spins is not evenly divisible by your bet (spin 2x for 11 spins, this happens at 1 spin left while spinning at 2x), the game will give you 3 pop ups, one to buy more spins, then a package, then a prompt to watch and add for A SINGLE spin. But if you got to this point by not doing 1 spin, you have probably 1 or 2 spins left, you need to use them so when you run out, now you get THREE MORE POPUPS!! This totals 10 pop ups.\n\nFor the issue of this game: Cards are massively flawed. I have like 12 sets I have not fully collected, yet ever super rare chest (you barely get them besides upgrading village) I receive literally the same card duplicate. I have over 5 copies of the same card when there are over 10 more 1 stars I could get that I don't have!!! Nope here is a duplicate! If you play, an event to trade duplicates for chests to get cards appear but if you do this, you simply removed your 5 copies to get 1 of the same copy because the randomness is not random for cards!!",

I don‚Äôt understand why you would make the game that way it makes your players lose interest. Spinning you can have full 50 spins and still won‚Äôt get a shield, raid or attack. This happens for days. Next issue when building your village it‚Äôs hard to complete when you have to fix an item multiple times after it was completed because you keep getting attacked. It will be really great if once an item is completed that item can not be hit. Maybe add ‚ÄúMiss Attack‚Äù option for picking an item that was completed and the reward can be the amount of Blocked Attack. Another BIG ISSUE is the cards. What‚Äôs the point of still getting cards from sets that you have already completed, you can‚Äôt get the rewards twice. If the set is completed you should not continue to get those same cards. For Gold Card event why all gold cards are not trade able. Again you can only use 1 card for your set what‚Äôs the point of having 15+ of the same card. I really hope you start listening to your game players and all that I have said has been a problem for most players.

        "message": "Like other players, I really enjoy the game. However, there is a huge disparity between the coins and stars you win and the coins and stars you have to spend. For example, stars are used to complete tasks. BUT, you only get ONE star per level you beat and tasks like fixing a fountain can cost up to a DOZEN stars to complete, so it takes forever to move forward in the game. And some of the tasks are just stupid. Calling someone is 1 star, having them come look at the problem is another, then fixing the issue can be 6 more, but then something goes wrong and you have to complete another task before you can finish the first one! As far as coins go, you win 50 per regular level and 100 per hard level you beat, with each leftover move, bomb, rocket and airplane giving you one to two extra coins. Now, if you need one or two extra moves to win a level, it will cost you 900 coins for five moves. That‚Äôs 180 coins per move. If you win in two moves, you‚Äôll get 3-6 coins back on the unused moves that you just paid 540 coins for. You can‚Äôt get much more unfair than that! They also have lots of  ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù levels that you‚Äôll either have to play until you just want to delete the game altogether, you‚Äôll eventually have things hit just perfectly so you win or you give up and spend real cash on coin packs.

I would occasionally spend some actually money to get some extra turns or boosts, but you get to a point where you can buy extra lives and use up all your boosters and you‚Äôre still stuck on the same level until you essentially get lucky with how the pieces fall and end up with enough bombs/rockets/etc to finally beat the level. I‚Äôve found this to be especially true at 600+, with every level feeling like a ‚Äúhard level‚Äù in that you don‚Äôt benefit from playing the level a few times, losing but getting to know the dynamics of that particular level and getting closer to winning each go around; it literally feels like it takes dumb luck to win. I don‚Äôt spend money on this game anymore because the extra 5 lives don‚Äôt feel worth it when you‚Äôre just going to lose over and over - might as well wait until the lives have replenished and not spend money only to be frustrated. Also, I was excited when they started the little side game like in gardenscapes, but it has been far far too difficult to even bother. This week‚Äôs first couple levels make much more sense as far as difficulty level for the first two levels of a side game, but then you can hit a wall at three with no chance of completing all eight levels without having to spend money; pretty disappointing.",

        "message": "I have played many, and I mean MANY, games such as this one in my lifetime. I find them to be fun and even addicting. Although the concept of the game is great, and I‚Äôve only been playing for a short while, something needs to be improved with the coin/lives system. Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn‚Äôt sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it‚Äôs so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That‚Äôs a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient. I also think 28 minutes is a long time to wait for one single life. I don‚Äôt want to give up on this game with not a lot of time put into it already, but if there is no improvement, I might have to.",

And you just better break out your dollars because some levels you will be killing yourselves to win. Like 498 level I am not going to spend anymore money on this game. And the few moves it gives you to play and the purple blocks that has the bugs in them good luck they get much harder in higher up levels. This level it has the regular white blocks that grow but the purple ones you have to kit them 2 to 3 times and they grow back just one to two moves after you remove another side. To get extra coins for more lives or boosters it is a lot of money for what little you get. 900 coins you get 3 this. And 1900 coins you get 3 globes. The lives run out so fast and sometimes my friends send me lives I see them and play one game go back to collect the life because it won‚Äôt allow you to have 6 life‚Äôs and it is missing. I am in the room right at the stairs I forget what it is called. Looks like another living room to me. The outside green house it felt like it took years to finish the plot line. I wish you could request the boosters but place them where you want them if you want them in the game. Like they would be added to your side menu but not dropped down in the puzzle because it places them and there would be a awesome move but the boosters messed it up and you only can use the boosters there is no other move.",

I like Homescapes much better than gradenscapes just because the colors and the graphics are better int my opinion. At least the game is a little better.\n     The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It‚Äôs annoying how fast your stars run out. What‚Äôs even more annoying, it‚Äôs that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you‚Äôve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.\n     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! üòÜ\n     Please take this into consideration.

I only use the coins I earn and the prizes I win with the calendar and events, sometimes it doesn't work out and I don't beat it but it doesn't mean I have to pay to win, I spent weeks on a level before keep trying don't give up and when you finally get a good set up the satisfaction is greater when you win.

What roped me in to downloading this game was the home decor aspect. As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched. Don't even get me started on the baking storyline. 6 stars just to bake the cake base. Another 3 to bake the house cake. Another 3 to frost it. Another 3 to put it together. Then 2 to drive it to the studio. Then 2 to celebrate the win. Then another 2 to open a present for winning... it doesn't stop! I didn't download the game to bake a cake.

I do wish there were easier ways to get money to buy the extra garden designs examples the fairytale and Greek looking garden options or drop the price because over 8000 for some will take forever to get also it‚Äôd be nice for more options of getting lives not everyone has friends that can send lives to them or can get into one of those alliances with a lot of active people so I think a way to get lives easier would be nice I get so into the game then get stuck waiting thirty minutes just for one life. I love the game though other than that I definitely can‚Äôt complain it‚Äôs so much fun. I also love how they give you chances to change the house I think we should get an option to paint the house the colors we want also it‚Äôll give it even more of our own personal touch to the house when not using the holiday themes. Keep up the great work. I‚Äôd of given 5 stars but because of those few things I feel would help the game I gave 4 hopefully in time I can give that 5th star because this game definitely deserves it please consider adding better ways to get lives and money to buy in game items and painting the house for our own personal touch for when we aren‚Äôt using one of the holiday themes.",

        "message": "This game is definitely addicting and can be fun, but also very frustrating at times. As others have mentioned the levels get progressively harder as you go on. You can end up wasting lots of power ups and coins trying to beat a level and still lose. Also the rewards stay pretty much the same so you‚Äôre basically always getting diminishing returns as you play.\n\nBut by far the most annoying thing for me is the multi-step process needed to restart a level when you lose or decide to quit. Whenever there is any kind of challenge active where you have to collect things or earn rewards, there is always a pop up where Austin asks if you are ABSOLUTELY SURE you want to lose your rewards/collected items from that level, trying to get you to use your coins and continue. Yes Austin, I am 100% sure I would rather give up these 15 apples I matched than waste my coins on 5 more useless moves that will bring me no where close to winning the level.\n\nOf course there is no option to disable these popups, probably because they are just a poorly disguised attempt to get people to spend money on coins. This used to be less of a problem because there weren‚Äôt always challenges going on so usually there would be no popup. Now the challenges are constant, and I have to mash the end level button multiple times to blow through Austin‚Äôs unhelpful advice every single time I lose or quit.",

The match-3 levels are pretty addictive and challenging, and they're always changing and adding new features, so it stays fresh and interesting. At the same time, you're fixing up the gardens and having adventures with Austin. All the neighbors you meet are fun characters, with interesting backstories. It's all gorgeously rendered, and totally bug-free. You can play offline. Fun little events happen pretty frequently. Best of all, there's practically ZERO ad-presence... you have the option of watching videos for coins from time to time, but ads are never shoved in your face. I think this game is designed to appeal to older adults-- hence, the 80's-supermarket-style music, but I really think anyone can have fun with it.

Depending on what you are trying to accomplish (clean an area, plant a tree, renovate an architectural structure), the game requires so many stars for each task. Many times the required stars are more than what I think is reasonable, or they break the task up into 2 or even 3 parts (meaning even more stars). Finally, the special events like transforming the mansion or a part of the garden for the holidays (Christmas, Halloween...) have a time limit, but no break on the number of stars or an increase in coins to ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù more boosts.

They‚Äôve dropped the amount of moves you make at each level, and it‚Äôs now more a ‚Äúpay to play‚Äù game. Constantly promoting competitions, etc. but to achieve any kind of awards you need to pay for bonuses, lives, etc. to move forward. Yes, it‚Äôs your choice to pay or not...however when/if you don‚Äôt, you can be stuck on a level days or weeks! No exaggeration! And if you use bonuses to start with that you can win 1 each day spinning a wheel, they put the bonus (bomb, rainbow, etc) in a useless spot that you either have to use immediately to make your next move, nullifying the bonus or putting it somewhere where it‚Äôs stuck and you can‚Äôt use at all. It was fun to begin with...my favorite part is decorating the garden...I really enjoy that and competing with my team for prizes. However to continually get stuck with no chance of winning before your time is up and then because you‚Äôre not advancing you can‚Äôt compete for prizes in competitions and get rewards, not fun. Unless and until they fix some issues (others complain about constant crashes, missing awards, etc) and reinstate the moves you took away a few months ago... I may be done. Sad when all a game thinks about is how much money they can take as well as enjoyment. And tech support is non-existent. Gamer beware....",

        "message": "Overall I love this game. HOWEVER, there is one issue that irritates me endlessly, and I‚Äôm writing this review hoping it gets resolved. In some levels in which the goal is to get the punch cups to drop to the bottom of the map, there are little nooks that allow for the rainbow blast power up to drop down into the nook in the space below the cup, so that you can‚Äôt use the rainbow blast because the only thing to switch it with is the cup. If this happens, there is no way to win the level!! The rainbow blast is blocking the cup, and no amount of blasting with bombs will move the rainbow blast out of the way. The ONLY way to win would be to use the little ‚Äúhand‚Äù special to switch the places of the cup and the rainbow blast. So if you don‚Äôt have that, you basically waste an entire life and any other power ups you started the game with. Like is said, compared to the entirely of the game, this problem is small, but it is definitely a design flaw that causes me to just waste entire levels! It‚Äôs SO SO SO aggravating because it‚Äôs different than the level just being difficult- rather the level by design and chance is impossible. At the very least, provide a ‚Äúsurrender‚Äù option so that I don‚Äôt have to do random swipes for 10 moves knowing that the level has become unwinable.",

That‚Äôs part of the challenge. The only thing that bugs me more than levels being a bit too challenging at times is having to add crap to areas. It sounds so nitpicky as I type this out, but here goes. So we finish the fountain in the garden and then change the basin to a statue that takes like 9 stars to finish? It really takes a long time to finish any area in the garden when we have to do that stuff. I‚Äôm all for the challenging levels, but how many stars it takes to do the changes is a bit much. How about giving us the choice of a decoration: maybe the butler really wants the peacock for the basin in he fountain and it costs 3 stars. You like the angel for the basin  and it costs 2 stars, maybe the original basin costs 1 Star. Just an idea. I think it would be more fun to have a choice that way.",

What is the point of reviews if you don't care what your players say? I play other games and never have I had to spend this kind of money playing a game.  It is impossible to earn coins from the game because you have to use what you earn (it is a ridiculously small amount) it to buy power ups so it's impossible to build on what you earn.  I am almost always at zero.  Very disappointing. And the fact that you have to wait another 30 minutes to play again after the five measly chances you are given is stupid.  I enjoy the game and unraveling the garden however until you fix the issues people are writing about, it is not worth it!

The firecracker rocket things (the icon is a colorful cluster of three of them together) are normally supposed to go after crates or firefly jars, things you need to clear the level.

This is especially infuriating when I‚Äôve got all the extra power ups from the treasure chest like the extra turns, bombs etc but then because the stupid rockets go after the ticket instead of the needed item to clear the round I end up losing and because I don‚Äôt have 900 coins left I loose the treasure chest items. \n\nThis keeps happening and it‚Äôs super frustrating. If the rockets are supposed to help you clear times needed to finish the level then have it do that 100% of the time.

Of course the game is rigged... this type all are.   But the egregious failing is that after a run of easy or challenging but eventually surmountable levels, the game ‚Äúrules‚Äù are suspended at a specific level clearly in order make a level nearly impossible without purchasing aides.  Clearly the games are not meant to be ‚Äúfair,‚Äù but sometimes they are insulting .... just trying to wear you down ... and that‚Äôs where I stop for a while ... no fun.  Today I  played my last game, for this reason and others.  Had enough.  Toon Blast has the additional irritation that that it flips the position of the buttons to ‚Äúspend‚Äù game coin compared to the sister game Toy Blast - with no chance to correct yourself - for 5 more steps - so that it is easy to select the button by mistake.  The only reason for this inconsistency is to trick players meanly.  Enjoy the game but don‚Äôt say we didn‚Äôt warn you.  When you are tempted to get mad, just remember their goal is to make money... play or don‚Äôt ...

It‚Äôs not that any of the levels you go through get harder.

Also, it gets monotonous after awhile because the added obstinate they put in there are reused just with a different appearance. I think there could be a lot more work done to improve this game.

If you look at online walk-through‚Äôs of the various levels, you will immediately notice that they have reduced the number of moves-per-level; making it extremely difficult to completely many of the levels, without the aid of bonus ‚Äútools‚Äù or extra turns; all of which require you to purchase expensive packages of these items. I frequently find myself in a position, where I am just one or two moves away from competing a level; when I run out of turns. \n\nAnother pet peeve; is the fact that weekly ‚Äúteam tours ‚Äú have prizes that are equally divided up between those who contribute substantially to the win, as well as those who merely play a single level, to qualify for participation, and do nothing else.

When there is a team challenge Sometimes I do spend money, as I‚Äôve always been a team player and I like to win. They promised 50,000 if you win, however, they paid each player (50 on a team) 1000 and the majority of our players have dropped the game so they‚Äôre getting what some of our players have worked very hard for. We can‚Äôt get rid of the players who quit playing. Only the team leader can do that and unfortunately he has quit playing as well the solution to this is to start a new team, but I like my team and as I have said I am a team player they should only give The players who actually played on the team challenge that. This would solve the problem or get rid of the team leader when they see they are not active this would make the game a lot more fun and I wouldn‚Äôt mind spending a little bit of money on a team challenge! I may quit playing soon myself but as for having to spend the morning I am around level 1500 and I am beating the levels! Just feeling a little cheated at this point!!",

Whether your on level 1 or 3001 you will get the same rewards for beating 10 levels and achieving 20 stars and with the weekly tournaments the most you will win is $1000 coins. Recently the game added daily challenges where you can win $100 in coins for achieving a goal but the game makes it impossible to achieve the goal or beat a level sometimes to get these coins...even with the weekly tournaments you can be stuck on a level for days during the tournament time frame but as soon as the tournaments done you beat levels. The game needs some new rewards like unlimited lives for 24 hours or an atomic bomb that blows up the whole board OR to allow use of rockets and bombs that you earned during the game not only at the start of the game.",

Many, many times I‚Äôve been stuck in a level, used up all of my lives (at times, up to 19) then bought another 5 with 100 coins and beat the level immediately. I‚Äôm fairly sure you‚Äôre given a 50% higher chance of beating your current level if you spend the in-game currency, but I don‚Äôt think it has to be actual money to give you an edge. Regardless, if that‚Äôs true (which we‚Äôll never really know) it‚Äôs very wrong and angers me a lot.\n\nI‚Äôve maybe paid actual money twice to pass a level. For my girlfriend, however, I‚Äôve spent in the area of around $30 so we could keep playing before bed and having fun. If it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs enjoyable in a unique way, then it feels worth it, but I‚Äôve never felt content after doing it just sitting in my chair alone. My girlfriend agrees, though, that paying is really foolish.\n\nAll in all, it‚Äôs a great game which, clearly, a lot of work has been put into making, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever worth it to pay to win, even if your team is depending on you to beat a challenge.

The fact that you guys were so eager to release this game before it was finished, before you had the server capacity (that‚Äôs not totally your fault though this game initially blew up more than anyone could have thought), there was no features to battle, interact with friends, no raids or gym battles, the radar had constant problems, you guys wouldn‚Äôt allow anyone to use radars because your guys‚Äô app kind of sucked at the time. You guys just handled this game extremely poorly during the initial first 6 months. Instead of releasing the game unfinished to make money, why didn‚Äôt you at least add features that would have made it fun to play with friends? Yes the raids were a great edition, but the new problem is that there are so many players that quit that I can never catch any legendaries because none of my friends and no people are out actively playing the game anymore. This game would have actually been fun to play and probably would have kept more players if it even had just some of the features that it does now. But because it doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs simply too difficult to do some of the really awesome things unless you have a dedicated group of like 15 people who will go out together and do raids.

The inner economy of items and Pok√©mon‚Äôs creates a wonderful system that makes you want to come back and play more. But, there are a lot of issues to still work out. One of which is the coins and gyms system. Right now, you can only get 50 coins per day. And a pokemon earns a single coin per 10 minutes in a gym. You would reach the max limit for coins in about 8 hours. This creates an issue, in which, if you have 4 pokemon in different gyms that have been in there for all over a day. Well over the limit. Meaning you could make 200 coins total, if they get defeated on different days. However, if they are all defeated on a single day then you only receive 50 coins for all 4, missing out on the 150. Currently, there is no work around this issue. You can‚Äôt recall your pokemon early, and if one gets stuck in a gym you are sitting there praying for it to be beaten. Another issue is with the combat leagues. When I first started the game with my most powerful pokemon at about 1000cp to try out the feature, the opponents were vastly unbalanced. I had to fight a 3000cp mewtwo on my 4th or so fight. It just seems that some of the features weren‚Äôt given enough time as opposed to other features of the game, and that lackluster approach clearly shows.",

Also during gym battles, there should be an option to switch Pok√©mon in between defeats. Those are the rules in a real Pok√©mon battle and this should be applied to this game.

I understand if raids have to take place in towns, but it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to have at least some amount of pokestops near communities. I live near a local park and there are zero pokestops there. I understand that there‚Äôs an option to create pokestops indirectly through another Niantic game, Ingress, but from my experience that game isn‚Äôt properly optimized for newer iPhones, and the base-building system is clunky and tedious. It would make more sense for Pok√©mon GO players to create new pokestops in gardens and parks, so that they can more easily play the game away from the city or towns. Another minor complaint is the sound. What was the deal with the sudden degrade in sound quality? Was that for saving battery life?\nAnother good thing to add would be to battle other players‚Äô Pok√©mon directly, instead of going to a raid or a gym and battling their Pok√©mon there. Niantic still needs to realize that not all of their player base is willing to drive 10 miles to go catch and see Pok√©mon. If these issues would be fixed this game would be 5 stars.",

However, ever since global was taken out of the game, it has been much harder to find and get new non-rushed, kind, and loyal members to join our clan. I know global was taken out because many players abused it and were mean to other players, but I believe it was a very important part of the game to find new friends that you would enjoy talking to, and playing the game with. The new thing that helps find clan members (in my opinion) is not very useful. Most of the players are very rushed which don‚Äôt fit the requirements of the clan I‚Äôm in. \n\nOne other change I would like to see is the time it takes for buildings and troops to upgrade. The gold pass is a very good option to shorten the times, but I‚Äôm still a kid without a job, so I‚Äôm not always able to use 5 dollars to buy the gold pass. I have gotten it many times before, but without it I‚Äôm struggling to ‚Äústay on schedule.‚Äù I‚Äôm a TH11 at the moment in the ending stages of it.

I hate it when you finally get the 2 million gold for an x bow, and it makes you wait 3 days on top of that. It makes the game so much less enjoyable. Same goes for training troops. I love attacking and forming strategies with my troops. But it is kinda annoying that it makes you pay for the troops AND wait an hour and a half to even use them. I don‚Äôt mind some of the waiting, but waiting for more than 1 day for a seven dps upgrade that also costs you 1.5 million gold is ridiculous.

My favorite part of the game was the community you could find just by going into global chat and talking. You could meet people from all over the world, compare bases, brag about your clans, or just get to know each other. Upgrades and troop training take a long time, so to pass that time I‚Äôd just hop on global since you could always find someone to talk to. I just got back on the game after a year long break however and was amazed to see they had REMOVED GLOBAL CHAT. That was literally the biggest reason I played this game as opposed to other knock offs. I really miss it and know that the vast majority of players do as well. I know it saves money and work to have it gone but maybe they should consider having a paid version of the game that includes the global chat or even a subscription bc I would literally pay to have it back again. Other than that failure of a decision the gameplay is great, well balanced and entertaining.

The global chat was amazing because of finding new clans (replaced with a terrible recommended clan feature), discussing new strategies, patch notes, knowing that you weren‚Äôt the only person online, just finding new friends to talk to, and for base advice.

Whether it be troop upgrades or building upgrades, them taking days at a time is really time consuming. So is the troop training times, even when I have maxed barracks! The game is fun at first when you start playing it for the day, but once you get those two maybe three battles in for the home village, I end up relying on my other games to entertain myself. Troop training takes a little too longüò¨. Please shorten those times.\n\nThe other thing is global chat...I understand that people were being mean on it and so you took it away. But the thing is, one of these days I‚Äôm probably going to want to start my own clan. Global chat would really help with that. I think the punishments will work just fine for people who are mean. People might mute them, or y‚Äôall will ban them. As an example, when I was cussing on the clan chat with my friends, the next day I find I‚Äôve been banned for a couple days, and that future actions would lead to a permanent ban.

Also I don‚Äôt really care for the other castle thing over the sea.. a lot of people don‚Äôt care for it since they are grinding their main base all the time. It was way better when it was simple. Just a base, clan, clan wars, clan chat, and global chat. But the loot after you get raided is nice! Really like that feature! The others people don‚Äôt really do except clan games. Great rewards in that! That‚Äôs it for right now I think. Well time to go hop in and out of clans all day to find a decent one I fit into and like üòí",

        "message": "Clash of Clans is a game best played with friends. People will constantly say stuff like MicroTransactionMania but this just is not true. Yo can easily get gems in game, sure you might speed up the process with MicroTransactions but I never felt like they were a huge problem. The biggest problem this game has is what I call the silver crisis, this happens around silver league 3. At this period you hit a natural road block at which many people seem to quit. This road block being that once at silver 3 you will encounter lots of people with higher skill than you. This will lead to you attacking much higher bases than yourself and failing some people do this cycle of over confidence and failing will lead to some players to quit the game. There is also a issue with the walls being over priced playing some of the top single player missions and getting millions of gold will only allow you to upgrade a couple walls to level 12! And if your wondering at the time of needing to upgrade walls to level 12 you will have around 250+ walls! Another thing great about this game is the fact that it‚Äôs free game. It‚Äôs also been a around since 2012 and right now it‚Äôs November 2019 and there are still 100 million players that get on a day. This game is the best Mobil game in history.",

        "message": "Hey guys.  I‚Äôve been playing this game non-stop for 2.5 years and I still love it just as much as the beginning.  I have 3 accounts with the biggest being a maxed th9 about to be a th10.  Clan games are interactive,  wars are fun and genius and attacking is practical and requires strategy and tactic.  The reason i think people think walls are overpriced is because people focus too much on progressing the base and getting bigger and less about the teamwork that makes clash stand out from other iOS games EVEN clash royale.  Supercell did an INSANE job at matching up the amount of elixer needed AND gold needed to build and max ones base.  If walls were any cheaper,  Wed see massive stockpiles of gold on people bases when u try to attack a near-maxed TH.  My th9s troops and walls are going to max AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME.  After about th8 it mostly becomes a focus on getting into a clan that suits you and trying to build a war streak with other buddies.  It‚Äôs really the construction of a strong clan that makes the game fun.  U can do that at most any level.  Not good at wars?  1. Get better, 2. Clan games!  Everyone can do those and they make the clan look good. If ur impatient, we‚Äôll that‚Äôs why they made clash royale.  If ur a strategy and businessman like me, this is the game for you.

        "message": "This is by far one of my all time favorite games. Mostly everything they have ever done to the game is well thought out. However there are issues.1. The walls are too expensive for what they do. Nowadays everyone uses balloons, electro dragons, baby dragons, and miners. Walls do nothing against these troops. NOTHING! So I just don‚Äôt understand why they cost so much. I understand that there is a 20% off builders that can be earned through the season pass but upgrading walls should be able to be accomplished without spending 5 dollars every month.2. There is basically nothing you can do against miners. The best weapon in my base is the giant bombs against them. They either need nerfed or there needs to be some sort of weapon against them. 3. There needs to be more builders. The new Otto thing that was added is cool but this can only be earned from doing outrageous amounts of work in a separate village. One that I have no interest in whatsoever. There should be the option to buy more than 5 builders in the home village that I would gladly buy with gems that I have earned through achievements and clearing obstacles. That is all. These issues are a simple fix and would make the community as a whole a lot happier thank you.",

        "message": "The game is great: fun, interactive, and more. But when I attack sometimes the Ai in the troops doesn‚Äôt make sense. It might just be part of the game, but the Ai should at least follow some common sense. For example, if there is a giant, and he is 5 tiles from an archer tower that is surrounded by walls, but 15 tiles away from another archer tower with no walls, the giant will go for the archer tower with no walls, regardless of wall level or archer tower level. If there is a closer object, those troops should target that object, such as in the giant example, where he should have targeted the archer tower with walls.\nSecond of all, the clan matchups are not balanced. I am in a lvl 3 clan with decent players, but we only have around 5-7 players th 9 and above in wars. We get matched up with clans that are lvl 8-10, with almost all player having a th above 8. In the matchups, the war is already won, before anyone even battles. The wars usually end up either us demolishing the opposing team or vice versa. There was never in an inbetween where the players are tied in stars. My recommendation is to match up the clans based on a win-loss ratio. For example, a clan with 50% win rate might get paired up with a 45-55% win rate clan instead of a 30% or 85% win rate clan. Anyways, this is a great game, but some things can be really frustrating.",

Every time I play ranked I find myself paired with horrible players which I think is extremely unfair. I hate doing so good only to end up being defeated because majority of my teammates can‚Äôt get over 2 kills. It‚Äôs very frustrating and extremely slows down the progression of my character. You guys should‚Äôve let ranked matches be unlocked at level 27 or 30 because I‚Äôm sure there are other players who feel exactly the same way. Or at least pair up people who are around the same level in ranked matches. Every time I see someone below level 20 on my team it makes me not even want to play because I already know what‚Äôs going to happen. Please balance this out so I can actually level up and have fun with the game. EDIT: ok now I‚Äôm starting to think ranked matches are a bunch of A.I, cause my team could be doing so good and have a score of like 30-17 and somehow at the last second the other team catches up out of nowhere. This isn‚Äôt a rare occurrence either, this happens EVERY SINGLE TIME I play ranked. There‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs a coincidence and I‚Äôm getting sick of it.

        "message": "Let me start with why this is a 4 star game and not a 5 star game: the micro transactions. Now I know the game is free but the ad placement is tricky and done in such a way that could easily fool a new user or a child into purchasing something. Every time you start the game you get a slideshow of all the new things you can buy and it‚Äôs just really forced. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the loot box drop rate controversies. With that out of the way, the game is not pay to win. Although you‚Äôll move along faster, it connects you with people around your skill level (probably one of the best features) so you‚Äôre never in a lobby with someone who paid to get to the max level. And the low level guns actually hold up well for the whole game. A lot of classic BO2 and MW maps made the cut, I‚Äôd like to see more maps in the future though. The battle royale mode is really fun too, it‚Äôs mostly based around equipment upgrades which encourages exploration rather than camping bc until the endgame you can almost always find better gear that‚Äôll give you that slight edge during the final 2. I‚Äôve already touched on this but the matchmaking is fantastic; it‚Äôs quick, not a lot of lag even on mobile connection, and it automatically pairs you with people within your skill range so there‚Äôs a constant sense of improvement as you rise through the ranks.

I wasn‚Äôt expecting much when I started. I was expecting just another free to play shooter that had too many micro-transactions that would make the game pay to win, have way too many ads that would annoy you at every corner, and graphics that wouldn‚Äôt be anything to brag about, but not horrible. I am confident that call of duty mobile is not only better than most mobile shooters, but even tops most of the newer console and pc call of duty games. I have been playing it consistently for the past few days, and I plan on playing for a good long time. Now, I‚Äôm making the game sound perfect, but I only have one issue. That issue being that the micro-transactions are too expensive. The reason being that the micro-transactions cost is exponentially more than the console prices are. But that doesn‚Äôt hinder the gameplay, as you can buy guns via micro-transactions, but the guns you start with still compete and are good at even high level matches. The game is a must try for anyone that likes battle royale, or casual multiplayer matches such as team death match or domination.",

My Idea is to add The more Popular guns and favorited guns. Since i am a sniper i would really like the Ballista, DSR (both from call of duty black ops 2). And please don‚Äôt make it where u have to Pay for new guns. i like the guns we have but since i snipe I only have a Artic and the other sniper u get at the early levels (forgot what its called. im writing this review with my experience of the game and what i would like to see in the game). there are some hackers but you guys are keeping a constant ban. The FPS and Lag are annoying. Sometimes when im trying to move, shoot and constantly look around, My game Just freezes then the joysticks and controls go crazy and it messes me up alot. Anyways the game is good  in general. but i think there should be more favorable and iconic guns added to the game fix some bugs regarding to lag, and when the game freezes.

It‚Äôs definitely up there, but, like every other game, I‚Äôve come across a few problems with this game. It‚Äôs not all gameplay wise, though. I‚Äôm gonna talk about bo4, and how that failed. It‚Äôs all because of the COD point promotions. This game is super fortunate to not go down the same path that bo4 did, cause they focused on gameplay a lot more. I just wish is was the bo2 days, where those god forsaken COD points weren‚Äôt even in the game. I personally liked grinding for weapons rather than wasting my life savings on a game. You see, when you grind, you earn the weapon or camo you want. It just feels so nice. But spending money on virtual golden coins to spend hours, and there‚Äôs a high chance you probably won‚Äôt get what you want. (I did this in csr2, and got nothing good with like 20 crates) That just shows that promoting silly virtual coins is complete waste of time and money. Just earning the COD points yourself feels so much better. That‚Äôs the major problem I have with the game as of right now, other than a few minor bugs. So, Activison, would you mind decreasing the COD point promotion stuff. I know it‚Äôs mostly a dollar only, but I don‚Äôt wanna see this game fall like bo4 did.",

The graphics are more fluent and the gaming interface is so much easier to maintain use. The only problem I have is how you have to spend money to be able to get certain skins. I am a firm believer that no mobile game is to have a dime spent on it, But this game gives out the vibe that all you can do is spend money for cod points to be able to receive any spectacular skins. Another problem I have is the class system, Why do you have to be level 60 just to unlock your 4th weapon section? The logic behind it is clear but irrelevant. No way, shape or form am I saying this is a bad game, But I would suggest changing a few of the factors of the game. You should be able to transfer from credits to cod points at a reasonable amount of credits. This game should follow the lines of any other console cod, And not be based only on spending your money. And I dislike the fact that zombies mode only has one map, If you can make maps from older games for multiplayer why can‚Äôt you bring back the old zombie maps like Transit, Kino der toten, Or even the iconic nuke town.

Things like this make it stand out.

The customization and classes you can choose, overshadow blackout by a MILE! It feels amazing to get the #1, but it‚Äôs not too easy to where it feels pointless!\n3: Cannot wait for the zombies mode! I have grown up being a HUGE HUGE zombies fan, and to think that I could play as Ghost from MW2, slaying the undead! Well that‚Äôs just been a dream of mine for far, far, far too long!\nOverall: An amazing port that competes with its console counterparts, 5/5 stars easily!",

Even after that it‚Äôs a better mobile game than most other mobile shooters. The only thing that I would change about the game is the way they balance teams, for example I would be playing with my friend (both of us are level 10-20) when we would be matched up with people that are level 30-50 on the other team. But honestly even with that you can just grind off of a.i. matches to get better weapons so you can be better prepared for serious battle. Overall Call of Duty Mobile is a really good game that I recommend to both serious gamers and people who just casually play for fun, because if your a serious gamer then you can devote a lot of time to it and it‚Äôs really easy at the beginning just in case you‚Äôre someone who plays a game for a couple days then leaves it for another.

The controls are smooth, multiplayer is fun and competitive, the graphics are astonishing for a phone game, and battle royal is always a good time. This game is packed full of content that any Cod fans will love. \nMy main suggestion is to add clip size and reload time to the weapon stats in the load-out screen. I know this has been done before and it is helpful piece of information to have when making load outs. Especially when deciding on what new weapon to drop some weapon exp cards on. \nAnother suggestion would be to have a firing range, like in WW2, to practice shooting weapons. That way you can test weapon attachments and have a way to adjust/test your controls, because it is a real pain trying to set sensitivity and set a custom UI in the heat of a match. Not to mention the fact that you are going to have some angry team mates if you are in the corner trying to set your custom UI just the right way while they are practically carrying the match for you. \nI may think of other suggestions and add to this later, but right now that‚Äôs all I got.

        "message": "I‚Äôve spent nothing on this game so far and i‚Äôm amazed by how rewarding and fun it is. Usually in free versions of games you get to a certain task that‚Äôs impossible to achieve without spending money on upgrades, but not so this game. I‚Äôm a little obsessed with it, to be honest, and keep discovering new modes and challenges. The only thing bad to say about it is that it possibly gives you too many options. Almost anything you can do on the console version you can do on the mobile one. Minor complaint: It‚Äôs really tricky hitting the fire button on an iPad screen with nothing tactile like a button to rest your finger on (be prepared to reload a lot when you meant to fire!) but presumably all the other players have the same challenge, and i‚Äôve done pretty well regardless. I love the Battle Royale mode, which is an enormous world to traverse where you have to find weapons first to kill the other players. Most of the vehicles in that mode can be operated including helicopters which is totally fun, and the graphics are stunning. I‚Äôm shocked a mobile device is able to play such a game at all, frankly, it‚Äôs that good. And i almost never have game crashes or the glitches you‚Äôd expect in a processor-intensive game. The developer has knocked it out of the park as far as I‚Äôm concerned.",

However it comes to my attention that whenever I attempt to run past a hoard of zombies my character glitches and appears smack dab in the middle of the hoard. I try and I try but when I play zombies I don‚Äôt have any way to escape zombies when playing on my own. Also I spent two hours playing endless survival mode and I had two main issues, one is that after two hours and over four thousand kills I only got shards. Not a lot either. Two is that endless survival is not endless. It lasts for a little over three hours and then it ends! I think the axe - lava should have a longer reach as opposed to the knife. I noticed that when a player is trying to kill me with a knife I can be right up against their character and attack but it doesn‚Äôt work, then the one with the knife runs up and after I dodge the attack I die. I also think that sticks and stones mode should be a full feature with the gravity spikes and throwing axe as full features as well. If these issues are fixed with the ideas I had being listened to I will play twice as much. I‚Äôm thinking about buying premium pass plus and so you will make money from my end.

        "message": "This game is so much better than the other mobile shooter games. It outlasts them in every category, especially game mechanics. Instead of clumsily trying to press the aim button(which by the time you succeed and start aiming, you are already dead) it utilizes the fire button so it will aim + fire when you are pressing the fire button. This is extremely helpful in close quarters combat and not a problem in far range. With the sniper, the same applies except it fires when you let go. Another aspect of the game is the graphics and optimization of the mobile game is astonishing. Another plus is you get most of your favorite maps like hijacked and nuketown. There is no Advanced Warfare garbage yet the gameplay is still unique and fun. The Battle royale mode doesn‚Äôt have an original aspect as it incorporates many ideas from other games but is extremely fun to play. There is still micro transactions but doesn‚Äôt have a major or noticeable effect on gameplay(I haven‚Äôt explored micro transactions to much). I rate this game 5/5 because I thought it was going to be a letdown. I think Activision/Trayarch came through with this one(This exceeded my expectations because their recent games have been un enjoyable)and I hope to see more like Call of Duty mobile.",

        "message": "I started playing this game a couple weeks ago in the search to replace Tetris Blitz. I really like this game a lot, which is why I gave it 2 stars. But there are certain things that make it a bad game. For one, you can only get items to assist, like bombs, with diamonds. But most of the diamonds you earn through games are collected and held until you purchase them. It‚Äôs rare that you build up enough diamonds to purchase bombs and lasers in any significant quantity. There are certain levels, especially the timed levels, that are basically impossible to beat without several of the items you purchase with the rarely earned diamonds. Since I grew up in the time of arcades, I truly don‚Äôt mind spending money on games sometimes, as long as it‚Äôs reasonable. It‚Äôs not reasonable with this game. I wasted over $30 by the time I finally got disgusted with it and deleted the game from my phone. Since the game constantly asks you to write a review and then literally has one of the fish try to guilt you for declining, I wanted to make sure I left a detailed description of why I decided to stop playing this. I have bills to pay and food to put on the table. This game would have me highly irritated on a daily basis and that‚Äôs just not acceptable.m for something I was trying to use to relax and gain focus. Playing the same level 25 times for 2 days because the game is trying to force my money out of my pocket via frustration is just not satisfying. Won‚Äôt be back!",

Just got tired of the manipulative algorithm that would have you run out of moves or time with just one move to win. Also, annoyed when I still have a few moves but game won‚Äôt release the bubbles needed to finish level. So goodbye Fishdom, I won‚Äôt miss you and sure you won‚Äôt miss me. Also lowered my rating. The following is a previous review since I simply edited to say goodbye. Tiffer roll your eyes at this. Play this game as a way to unwind and mostly enjoy it. I spend some money on it from time to time but not much. A few times I‚Äôve almost deleted it because the game at times seems designed to make you spend money which I get, so I‚Äôm patient and stay stuck on a level at times for a few days. Really irritates me when the board is completely cleared and you have a few moves left and need only one more bubble but the game won‚Äôt release a bubble, grrr. Those are the times I nearly deleted. I also despise the new reward system of vouchers for designer fish. Yuck, those fish are ugly and I‚Äôd rather have the old reward system back where you get power ups. Another ploy to get players to spend. I‚Äôm in the 1700s on levels so been playing awhile. Maybe not much longer though if changes keep being made to squeeze me for money.",

I hate the timed levels, you basically just have to keep playing them until you hit a turn that drops enough bombs to just randomly blow up all the tiles because there's just no time for studying the grid and planning a strategy. You need patience for this game, or else be prepared to spend lots of real coin in order to keep playing and advancing levels. GET RID OF THE TIMER!\n\nUpdate: Now into the levels above 800. The game has only gotten worse. Now some levels have individual time bombs in the squares that you must take out before they count down and end the game before you're even out of turns. More and more it has become a matter of just taking turns until the level wins itself by dropping enough power-ups to complete the round. I'm getting very close to deleting the app entirely.\n\nAnother update: The game is actually CHEATING! For the last FIVE GAMES IN A ROW I have been left with nothing but one or two squid to capture, and the game simply stopped issuing new squid! I even used up my gems buying extra turns to clear this level, but still no squid popping up until after last turn has been played! That‚Äôs the last straw. Deleting now.",

I have continued a level about 12 times. 10 of those were by accident when was absolutely no way to win the level in five moves. I think when you hit the button by five more moves the game should ask you if that‚Äôs what you really meant. \nSecondly, There is really no such thing as infinity play. They give it to you, yes, but you‚Äôre really only allowed to win one or two levels. When you get to your limit of levels you can win on an infinity play it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you are on an easy, hard or super hard level,  You‚Äôre simply not allowed to win. I was pretty sure that was the case but I tried it on my last infinity play. I was on the easy level and I played it for two hours of infinity play and never won. If I tried to use a booster they would place the booster in the absolutely worst possible place that would actually mess up what you have would have started with if you had not used a Booster. If you came very very close to winning, all Poseidon a lightning bolt would appear in the very spot you getting ready to do something with. Amazingly enough, as soon as infinity play had run out, I won the level.\nI do not like games that are that contrived.",

If I have the lives from friends then I should be able to use them, it‚Äôll keep me playing longer and then I‚Äôd wait the time for the new lives.

That irks me and then I won‚Äôt play for a day or 2 cause I‚Äôm agitated.  Also, I think when you beat the \"event\" levels and receive an infinity lives for 2 hours, you should be able to start it when you're ready. Once you start you can't stop it, but if I beat a level and then get the unlimited lives for 2 hours, I end up losing it if I can't keep playing for that time period. It's a reward and you can make it to where you can't earn another one until that one is used but, it seems rather unfair that if I beat it and earn that at, let's say 10pm, I can't always stay up until midnight to use it. Or if I beat it at 8am and start work at 8:30am, I can't use it and therefore I lose it. That bothers me quite a bit.",

        "message": "I have submitted this issue several times and always get a response that truly makes no sense. I always play the Sloto Quest. In the early days (been playing this game for approx 10 years) I thought the issue was a problem with servers being overloaded or a software issue that would be fixed. The last time it happened I reported it again and got another answer that made no sense. So I quit playing. It had been about 6 mos since I had played and thought I would try one more time and low and behold I had the problem again.  Here is the issue. You start the Quest and as you progress it gets a little more difficult and I am totally good with that.  I am now in the next to the last game of the chapter and start playing. I am suppose to get 750 million. Yesterday I play for over an hour and got zero % of the 750 million. Now keep in mind that I have hit Big Win on several occasions and have hit smaller wins several times during that hour. I only needed 7.5 million to move the meter to 1%.  Played again today and still have not moved the meter at all. So.......since this isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened there is no other way this could happen except.......it is fixed so I can‚Äôt complete the Chapter or they slow it down so I can‚Äôt complete the total Quest in the 8 days.",

        "message": "My experience has been similar to the other negative reviews.  Have played for several years, and actually made it to 21,000,000,000 coins, only to be broke now.  Lost most of it during the quests where I was required to complete outrageous things like ‚Äúwin 4.3 billion coins‚Äù.  Seems the higher the level, the more you are required to bet per spin in order to win.  Now at level 2073 I am still expected to win 147 million in the first of the three daily quests, even though my coin balance is only 157 million!  The quests stopped being fun once I lost most of my coins and could no longer complete them.  When I was able to bet 3-5 million per spin, I would receive 3-5 SlotoCards and was able to complete several sets.  But now that I can bet 500K to 1M (or only play for 5 minutes), I rarely get a SlotoCard, and if I do, only one at a time.  Apparently the album feature is only for the ‚Äúhigh rollers‚Äù.  And the worst part, is that I NEVER receive the entire amount I win on any ‚Äúbig‚Äù or ‚Äúmega‚Äù win.  For example, my balance is 78,000,000 and I win a 10,000,000 ‚Äúmega win‚Äù.  My balance after that is more like 85,000,000‚Äìthey keep a portion of every large win.  Every time.  I have complained via the link in the help section and the reply is always that their ‚Äúrecords‚Äù do not substantiate my complaint‚Äîthen they give me a ‚Äúgift‚Äù of a few million coins.  I seriously don‚Äôt understand why the developers use this strategy.  Time to find a different slot machine gameüòï",

Unfortunately that‚Äôs how these games are.\nI am sucker customer that‚Äôs pays a lot to get very little... I am not upset at the game but in general bc if you can look at any ones history you can clearly see how much more do when actually win vs or loosing not just money but can‚Äôt seem to ever win a quest or complete any bonus games and win. I‚Äôve won before but after a long losing streak.... So I guess my main complaint is that do people actually win the quest if so how much money had they have to loose before actually winning???? Now again I do understand no one is making any one play but come it‚Äôs supposed to be little fun. You guys make the Slotomania‚Ñ¢ quest to hard to complete just for an ACE card. Any time I ever get an ACE is whenever you receive them in the lotto bonus with the balls.& yet have I ever won a really high number on that... This is supposed to be enjoyable but I loose way more than win. I know this a long message but my point is I just used all 100 duplicate cards spun the wheel got a decent amount of coins to loose like in 5 minutes... Ugh... Then I sucker in and buy a small package and a multiple 20 times spinner just to be out of more money and luck and have Lucy ask how am I enjoying my winnings um what winnings...  just up setting but it is what it is..\nHave a great day!!!",

As much as I love the number and variety of games within the app you have to choose from, I have to say, the game experience as a whole, has become VERY disappointing. From winnings that don't get added to landing on a bonus or scatter and the game freezing up only to find it wasn't saved!! NOW, I just went to collect my 86 million chip Lotto bonus for it to tell me I already did???!!! NOT ONE CHIP ADDED TO MY AMOUNT! Closed out, rebooted, NOTHING, gone! \nI don't know WHAT is going on Slotomania, but you're not the app I had always loved.\nIt‚Äôs very difficult to rate at the moment. The last three days have been nice but I can hardly give a fair rating on only a few days when overall it‚Äôs been so, incredibly, wishy-washy. You did take care of a couple problems I‚Äôd had in the last couple months with chips. I greatly appreciate the fast response on those two issues. There were however at least two more that were never addressed for over 600 million, and the other was 4-6 BILLION. That‚Äôs a big kick in the teeth to ignore.\nHope things STAY BETTER!! I don‚Äôt need to win every spin or need to win billions EVERY DAY (unless I‚Äôm losing all my billions!), but a fun fair game always makes more interested in purchasing chips. Ask me again when there‚Äôs been 4-5 months without severe issues. I‚Äôd be happy to rate! THANK YOU SLOTOMANIA!!",

That‚Äôs great and all except when the minimum bet is 70-80 million per spin and the bonus I get to collect is about 9 million with the sloto club bonus.  Let‚Äôs talk about the other bonuses I get to collect, the mystery boxes average win about 600,000 and gifts from other players. With the rewards level I am at I would expect more than 10,000 coins. Now to move on to the sloto cards, it seems with the higher your level is the harder it is to get the cards from random spins, I have had to bet 500 million a spin or higher to get them. Daily dash, task(bet 5+ billion coins) that is impossible to do without spending real cash on them. Again collection bonus is only 9 million every 2-3 hours depending on if I bought coins or not.  The game play is fun. The tasks are daunting. But overall I enjoy it.  I would like to see some of these items easier to achieve.  If I wanted to loose money real or digital and not enjoy the aftermath I would go to a real casino.  This is a game and meant to be fun. Not 5 minuets of fun every other day.",

If a person was looking for substantial benefit and eventual loss they would go to a real casino. Being able to pass the time and enjoy bonus rounds is what a slot game should be all about. Earlier versions of Slotomania‚Ñ¢ permitted a player to keep the coins they earned from a bonus round rather than lose them as quickly as they were won. Thinking that you may keep the coins longer because you purchased a package is clearly the wrong thought. I‚Äôve purchased packages and the coins are lost just as quickly.  There was a time when it was easy to collect billions of coins but that time is long gone.  All the bells and whistles don‚Äôt make it more fun, especially trying to find little tiny items in a plethora of unrelated objects for a few coins, not necessary. I will continue to play because it IS fun but not gaining one coin in 8-10 spins doesn‚Äôt make it FUN. Please lower the chances to win because no one is winning money. It‚Äôs just for FUN!!

I‚Äôve won money several times via gifts or what have you that I had not paid out. Just last night I won over 2 million from a gift and received none. This happens when you need it most I‚Äôve noticed. Just now, I attempted to purchase money back on the Turn Back Time feature,  and was unable too. Tried to break my piggy bank, stayed it was ‚Äúprocessing payment‚Äù but unable to break bank. . Several attempts failed and it isn‚Äôt because the card isn‚Äôt good, so what gives?  What I‚Äôve noticed is, you have the most trouble winning money and keeping money when you are close to a huge reward, like closing an entire book of cards for 48B, the game refuses to allow you to win or keep winnings or pay with winning cards. I played and won every challenge several times and received no new cards. Same for my husband who plays with me. You say it‚Äôs a game of chance but evidence speaks for itself, it‚Äôs rigged.\n\nUPDATE: Still playing, still love the game, just gets frustrating at times, such is life!

Another complaint is after you win a big pot on a slot don‚Äôt expect another one on the same machine as it will take back everything that it gave you if you stay on it. Move to another machine after a big win! The pop ups also get way out of hand trying to get you to buy more coins as there is no need to do this. Lots of things already on the main page to click on if you need more coins. Putting three or four pop ups pushing you to buy more coins takes away the fun of this app every time you load the game! So I‚Äôm rating this slot app 1 Star as many things need to be addressed to make this a better experience for the players. The tournaments on this app are also a scam as I bet millions of coins only to find out were I placed only returned a tiny fraction of what I bet. Really only the top two players received the majority of the prize. Make sure you see the pay outs before tournament play and not after as I did, you will lose a great deal of coins if you don‚Äôt finished in the top two! Pro‚Äùs for this app are that you can get many free coins each day if you know we‚Äôre to look! It‚Äôs the best feature of this app as even if you lost all your coins you can get free ones back and can keep playing the game.",

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happened over time but it‚Äôs no longer fun to play when you can‚Äôt get any bonuses, no big wins and end up losing all of winnings faster than you win anything. The games are great games but it feels impossible to win anymore. Every update says your making improvements and making it more fun for the players. I keep hoping to find truth in this and therefore keep playing giving you the benefit of the doubt. At one point I had over a billion coins. Now I can‚Äôt keep it over a hundred million. I‚Äôm very sad bc I feel like I‚Äôm going to have to delete this app soon. I can‚Äôt afford to keep buying coins and not seeing any payoffs in return large enough to keep me interested or keep me wanting to play. It‚Äôs not fun when you play a game for hours and don‚Äôt hit one bonus or large win in all that time. \n   Also, the prizes for getting ‚Äúbig wins‚Äù really aren‚Äôt worth much. Come on guys, start giving back to your loyal players who have been with you for the long haul and faithful, daily players. I don‚Äôt mind buying coins once in awhile but when I have to buy more than I‚Äôm winning, I might as well be spending my money on a real casino app where I have a chance to win real money back. This is suppose to be for fun. Where‚Äôs the fun??? What happened to the fun and excitement of this app that made it the best free casino app at one time?? Disappointed is all I can say.",

Of you buy coins from these people you get a short burst of mediocre wins (sometimes slightly better) then it goes into drain mode where they expect that you will spend more money (why not, they now have your account marked as one that is willing to spend).  Meanwhile the other accounts where I have spent no money have far too better winning percentages.  You‚Äôve jacked up minimum bets on featured slots to $500,000 which was recently $180,000.  Reduced bingo balls from what was previously 4-16 (or somewhere around there). The size of wins used to determine the size of prize box you won.  Now it is random and usually a mini.  You just got far too greedy.  The odds in many of your games are worse than the real ones in casinos.  Unless some major changes are made.  Myself, my wife, my mother-in-law (who has probably spent close to $1000 this last year) are all deleting the app.  We will not recommend your app and will make sure everyone we know never spends a dime with you.  Thanks for what was initially fun a few years ago and has slowly gotten worse as time progressed.  Nobody cares about how cool your games are if they can never afford to play them.",

The coins didn‚Äôt add to my account so I immediately contacted support with a full description of what happened. Shortly there after I received an email response that they had received my ticket and after their investigation they would respond accordingly. A week or so went by and no response, they did however respond to my second request on another issue (double charging). I send a second request with no response this morning I filed a THIRD request for a follow and was told that unless I could provide a screen shot, there would be no further inquiry into my ticket. How do you screenshot the failure of coins to be deposited on a winning? If the game is still going? I have bought a significant amount of coins and as another reviewer wrote the winnings are few and far between.

Many other sites have constant issues. My problem arose with a recent $60 package for 750,000,000 credits. During a high stakes bonus round, the game glitched and on spin 5 of 20, just vanished. I wrote and asked for a refund or the 750,000,000 credits. On spin #5, I was already at 70,000,000 credits and I was placed #1 to win the high stakes tournament. When I returned to the game, I was no longer even in top 3 and I‚Äôd lost even the credits I had won. I received a response almost immediately: Nope, we can‚Äôt give you a refund or restore your original credits,  but here is 100,000,000 credits. I responded, that isn‚Äôt satisfactory, and re-explained what had happened. No further response. Zilch. When we purchase packages, we have to trust that customer service will be responsive and take responsibility for glitches in game programming. Their initial response, then complete lack of follow up, was extremely disappointing. $60 for gameplay in which is it not possible to win any actual money ... it is realistic to expect they will take better care of their paying customers. I will never again play this game.",

Eventually, you run out of credits, and you either give up Jackpot Party, or you begin buying credits.  And they aren't cheap, because the game limits your wagering to fixed amounts.  And here's the kicker, you usually win after making a purchase, just enough to keep you going until they tighten up your odds.  To this scam, they have added in \"add on tournaments\" designed to push you wager more and more.  The most recent requires that you play specific games to win points to raise your daily reimbursement rates.  Your supposed to be playing against a \"team\", but all it does is prompt you spend more and more on credits.  If you have an addictive personality and/or a gambling problem, its $50 for this amount tokens $99 for more tokens and in reality, that money is better spent in a real casino where you have an very, very slight chance of winning enough to pay for a drink.

That being said, we have both noticed changes that we hope are temporary. Let‚Äôs take the Bingo game, instance. We had so much fun earning bingo balls and winning big money!  You could earn the balls just by playing, as well as earning them with a bonus prize. Then, you could earn great prizes!!  So much fun! \n\nNow, the bingo balls are skimpy to earn and usually the result of bonus games only. The prizes have also been decreased by a huge percentage. Also, for example, I played having 12 bingo balls and had one match!!  You practically need 75 balls to win most of the games!\n\nThe Dropdown Game is lame!  No matter where you drop the ball, it goes wherever you guys want it to go!  Bonus slot game time for a game no different than any other‚ÄîI thought that maybe the odds would be in our favor for that game‚Äîbut that wasn‚Äôt the case.\n\nMy last comment concerns overall wins in playing various slots. Big reduction in both number and amount of wins. Both me and my husband are hoping for a positive change soon. In the past we have spent money on tokens, but now we‚Äôre sure it would just be a waste...\n\nPlease, please, please go back to letting folks have fun while playing your games!!\n\nAlso, I play on this phone, but the majority of playing is done on our iPads.

I had to enter manually contacts as they called. Thought I had to restart everything so I started with fb. (That‚Äôs where I save my games)\nI was able to recover most of my games with the exception of my contacts and candy crush soda saga. When I attached soda saga to fb it picked up my new profile and started me back at level 1. I almost lost my father 6 months ago and I am his caretaker so I am in a lot of waiting rooms. I chose to start over thought it was funny at the time me playing against myself for highest score. My second go around I have made purchases to reach level 1900 or so. The most recent 4 days ago. Soda saga completed an update in the same time frame asked for my acceptance and password. The keyboard that appeared did not give access to the characters needed to complete my password. So I went through fb, using my second profile it picked up my first profile. So now I am back at level 330 and playing myself again for highest score. All moneys spent for the past 6 months is gone. I‚Äôve been waiting for a response from soda saga to resolve this issue. Nothing yet!! Fixing to let everyone know how disappointed I am!",

Also I‚Äôve heard a lot of rumors that this game cheats to make you lose so you can start the level over, buy gold to buy more moves, etc, an example would be it suggest a move that doesn‚Äôt help at all and won‚Äôt stop suggesting especially if it‚Äôs a cookie or a special piece don‚Äôt even get me start with that plus every time I make a move to save my cookie or special piece some how it still activates it and jeopardizes the whole game.

The problem is that they are too greedy...when you get to higher levels, you cannot go on without spending real money and lots of it.  I used to justify the purchases as spending on leisure.  But I am quite good at solving puzzles typically and the issue is that they  have made it impossible to solve without boosters.  The boosters they provide for free are rendered useless  by the way in which they drop the new pieces.  If you are looking for a fun match 3 game in which you can actually solve the puzzles with brain power, and in which the free boosters are actually rendered usable...I would suggest checking out a new game called Wildscapes.  It's really early yet, so it's hard to tell if they will eventually get greedy like  King  games...but so far that hasn't been the case.  I will not spend another penny on King until they do better...which is too bad because their creativity is wonderful.  But their greed is egregious.",

The rewards are great, but I miss the challenge of beating the levels using my own skill. I've beaten levels with 2 moves because of all the boost rewards when I'm sure I could've beaten them on my own. It would be helpful to have the option to pause or bank reward boosts and choose when to use them. \n2. I do not like the timed boost rewards. I'd rather have the option to bank them instead of being forced to play them or lose them. Sometimes I just want to play for a few minutes, but then I lose my reward. That's not a reward, that's holding players hostage. \n3. Some \"easy\" levels are beyond difficult. For example level 1027 is labeled easy, however, beating this level is nearly impossible. I had the rainbow boosts plus an extra candy bomb AND and extra color changing boost and didn't beat it. I lost every boost I had and am still on that level. \n4. GIVE THE CHOICE OF WHERE THE FISH GO! I have lost games because the fish don't go where I needed them to go. They often detonate other boosts that I am setting up for a power move. \n5. 10 gold bars for an additional 5 moves? These are difficult and costly to obtain. Give me the option of using an additional life for more moves instead. \n6. Lose the puzzle piece aspect of the game. It's pointless and annoying.",

I dare say you are better off not shelling out a lot of money for better heroes. If you take the slow steady approach you will have the ascension items before you need them most of the time. If you buy heroes you will end up having to wait for items to strengthen them far too often.\n   If I were to make one complaint it would be how the raids are handled. Never mind your team power score, or even the multiple times they have revised how they are calculated, they have little bearing on your ability to win raids. It all comes down to how many special attacks you get off. Who ever makes the most special attacks, wins. Special attack energy is almost always slanted. The winner typical makes two to three attacks for the losers one. There will be seasons where it‚Äôs slanted in your favor, other times it will be slanted against you. Those rare times you are equally matched a raid can last upwards of 30 moves or more.  If there were not rewards for engaging in raids, I wouldn‚Äôt bother doing raids.

I've been playing this game for around 2 years now and i am a member in a fantastic alliance who plays together for FUN. Granted I do have a hero that I got in Feb of 2018 as my monthly free luck of the draw and haven't been able to fully ascend and for the longest time I wasn't having any luck with lvl 20 training and then BOOM I started getting 5* heroes from training alone. Multiple heroes. And I've been able to ascend them pretty rapidly. Would I like to see some ascension items easier to obtain for everyone, absolutely! Would I like to see it not cost as much for certain things like upgrading buildings or research? Sure. But I get it and I still enjoy the game and I will continue to play the game. As for the \"pop-ups\" that appear....those are just letting you know what's being offered in the game. Close them out and start playing. It's that simple.

The game itself is a clever combination of elements built around a core match 3 setup. The defining gameplay feature centers on the placement of your matches on the board dictate what enemy you hit, it opens up a depth of strategy and fun not found in other rpg/match 3 mashups. As others have noted it is a looong term game. As far as requiring money to advance, It certainly helps, but there are many high level players in our alliance that have spent $0-$20 over a year span. Most frustrating element is drop rates on items needed to ascend your 5* heroes. Honestly if you play a lot you will be able to pick up the items you need to ascend 4* heroes regularly, but those dang top end materials are few and far between. It took me 10 months to get enough materials to max my first 5* hero. This game is a grind, the greed of developers can be a bit offensive, but the irony of spending money on gems to get better heroes is the better heroes are worthless until you play the game enough to get the items needed to make them stronger so it is really counterproductive to your game to do so.

        "message": "I started playing this game about a month ago since my 13 year old daughter was playing it and thought it would be fun to have this in common.  I quickly became addicted, trying to clear land and get dragon stuff.   About 2 weeks into playing I obtained a zen temple, apparently a prized item that cost me 250 coins.  It isn‚Äôt an item that you can purchase over and over, just one chance and that was it.  A while after I got the temple I realized it was gone and I have no idea how.  I figured I must have accidentally sold it, but had a hard time believing but couldn‚Äôt come up with any other reason for it to be gone.  More recently I had a larger dinosaur skeleton head disappear, again I figured I must have accidentally sold the item.  Well two days ago I had 12 jewels in my bank, 7 that I had for a while and 5 more that I just obtained.  I was very excited and decided to hold onto them to see how many I could get.  Two days later when I logged into my game, all 12 jewels were gone.  Now, with the loss of my jewels, which I know I did not ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù use, I‚Äôm sure that items are just deleting from my game.  I shared this with my daughter and she said she lost a dragon and thinks this must be a glitch in the game.  Very frustrating to work for these items and then to have them just disappear.  Consequently my passion for the game has decreased dramatically.",

Creating Wonders is a process but  with all the dragons there it becomes easy, time consuming, but easy. While the concept and the dragons reel me in every time, I don‚Äôt like the very limited number of chalices we get...and watching ads for a single one is quite frustrating - I never care the chalice levels anymore. And the events...Ooooh...how I almost dislike playing the events. If it weren‚Äôt for the prizes I would forget about it, but alas...I do enjoy having special stuff on my land. The dragons used for the events take forever to harvest the point treats - two tiny dragons! One takes at least 1 minute while the other 15 seconds. I am unaware of how everyone else plays the events but it‚Äôs laughable to me how two dragons almost never get me halfway to the reward I want. And the land healing bit...if the orb harvesting didn‚Äôt take too long and high level orbs didn‚Äôt cost almost 300 gems in the shop (it‚Äôs like $15-$20 for one high leveled orb) it‚Äôd be swell.

The levels are fun and gradually become more challenging, and the camp can keep one occupied for hours. The story-despite being presented in a cutesy manner-is subtly dark enough for an older player to appreciate. However, I have two problems. Starting with the more trivial one: trophies. Needing them to play levels is fine, and even the time it takes for them to refill them is no real issue. But the fact that the max number you can have at one time is seven? I don‚Äôt know, I think it would be better at ten. Seven just seems like such a random number, and lets you play maybe one or two levels-ten is a more sensible number, and would allow you to get through three or so before running out. But that isn‚Äôt enough to ruin this game. What really bothers me is the gems. I really hate the fact that there is no reliable way to get gems. You will never have enough to take advantage of all the cool gem-based features like the royal hatchery or the zen temple. I love those features-but I can‚Äôt use them because the only way to get gems is through purchase with real money. I understand that money needs to be made somehow-so rather than charging for a crucial part of gameplay, it would improve the game infinitely if a price of two, three, even four bucks was charged for the app, and a way to collect gems within the game was added.",

I‚Äôve spent around $200 so far and sitting at 13 million points. Dragon power is approx 4500. I‚Äôm not spending anymore. Lol they are serious in tempting you to spend! They spit out chests and vaults non-stop and the only way to open them is to buy jewels/chalices. I‚Äôm telling you it‚Äôs ridiculous how many they give you. There‚Äôs no way to turn the chests function off. If you opened all of them you‚Äôd spend a fortune. $200 is actually more then i wanted to spend. Trust me I did spend thousands on those war games. So I sell every chest/vault that pops up for coins. Every one of them. It is hysterical. It‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôve got an algorithm that will keep popping out chests out until you open them. The game is fun and I enjoy it. You don‚Äôt have to spend much money at all if any. All of the different dragons look and function nicely. They have events often which I like.

There are different kinds of game play with different challenges and rewards (camp v. world map levels). It‚Äôs fun to level up the items, especially the dragons. \n\nCons - The problem comes in that at every turn the game is hungry for real cash (dragon greed?) to buy the in game currency. Want to open a (maybe useful) chest? Pay! (Rewards from chest stink? Pay more!) The mining aspect is cool, but beware that the dragons don‚Äôt necessarily mine from the highest level things (i.e., level 2 flowers and level 9 flowers... and they‚Äôll pick the level 2 flowers). It‚Äôs annoying when the difference between the result of mining from a low level or high level item is dramatic, and you only have so many moves without letting the dragons sleep to recharge (of course, you can pay to wake them). \n\nNot spending money is an option... just not if you want to move along at a satisfying pace. Would be a lot more fun IMO if the dragons defaulted to mine highest level things; less consumables or more in-game currency rewarded for achievements; or at least make it so that when one does spend money the ‚Äúreward‚Äù is fair (try opening a low level egg chest? Think it‚Äôll be better to open the big one, right? Well... maybe... though a bunch of rain puddles and some random low level junk didn‚Äôt seem worth the equivalent cash).",

I wish Merge Dragons gave some ways to earn gems in addition to micro transactions. Some games I‚Äôve seen, have an exchange system and it would be cool to see that in the game. Maybe like 1000coins to 10gems or something and vise versa. Before the game would allow players to work up to a dragon star (which gives gems) during events but they don‚Äôt do that anymore... it‚Äôs exceedingly hard to collect gems without purchasing micro transactions. I‚Äôm stuck on a mission that requires me to open 12 egg chests which the smallest egg chest costs 9 gems to open. And it takes gems to skip a quest too... so I‚Äôm stuck with these quests until I somehow get enough gems to finish or skip.\n\nPoint being, if there was an exchange system for coins to gems and etc, or even just watching videos for gems that would be perfect!",

As well, the drop rates are nice at first, then become all about making you spend money.  Latest patch only made things more expensive.  They give you so many premium currency chests without ways to really gain that currency after the first portion of the game so your camp is full of stuff you have to sell for nothing or pay handsomely for in real world money.  $6.99 for a starter island... Well you can see where it's going.  If you want to get people spending money in the game so they continue to spend, you need some low-price high value feeders.\n\nEdit: Also, now the $6.99 island at least shows what you get, but it also says it's -58% off?  Uhmm, you can't just say something is on sale when it was never higher to begin with, there are laws against that.  I know they could say it costs 58% less than if you bought gems and got that stuff, but given that it's a unique area it's not comparable to other items/prices and the way it's displayed is not indicative of that.  As it stands, it's pretty badly designed and potentially illegal in some localtiies.\n\nEdit: an update, bringing more free stuff! Except no... just more ways to spend gems. Everything free is locked by gems.  Coincidence that even less gem stars seem to fall? Should rename it from Gram games to Grab games as in money grab.",

I should be able to open the egg chests that emerge from it for FREE instead of having to pay a ridiculously high amount of gems to open them. The hard work in this game is NOT WORTH IT! There also needs to be a revamp in the chalice system. If I beat a level, I should be able to replay the levels for maybe 1 chalice. There should be a way, like most games, to level up your max amount of chalices. Maybe when you unlock a new piece of land? It takes 50 minutes to restore 1 chalice and some levels are all 7 chalices to play, which results in 1 level in 5 1/2 hours. I have beaten all of the levels, now I‚Äôm trying to get all stars and the challenges are hard to complete. But I lose interest when I can‚Äôt beat it and I have to wait several hours to play again. Considering every review has something along these lines, there will clearly not be a change unless perhaps someone else creates a similar game for competition.

Yes, the dragging is an absolute drag, but so are the wait times. Wait for your dragons to sleep, wait for more chalices, wait for things to pick up the pace...

It only needs some polishing, but when it gets that, I can promise a lot of people will consider picking it up again.\n*EDIT*\nAfter going through a bit, the drag time was so much smoother. Wait times remain annoying, but leaving the game and revisiting later is the remedy. However, dragon gems remain a pain to collect. (Not to mention some of the prices for in-game items. If dragon gems were easier to obtain, they might be reasonable, but the pricing gets pretty absurd. Maybe a coin-to-gem transaction could exist? Just a suggestion.) Good game overall!",

My personal policy is not to spend any money on a free game until played it for at least six months.  When you decide to start this game make sure you link with FB to save especially if you have invested any money. I also recommend taking screenshots as wide as possible and occasional pictures of your dragon book pages. The development team is EXTRAORDINARILY HELPFUL AND SUPPORTIVE in helping you recover if you have the data and save your game often.   Also Google Merge Dragons Wiki for great tips and tricks.   So on one hand I find the beginning game too slow to live unless you spend money on gems. If you get through the beginning one way or another the game begins to get momentum and is more playable.

Chalices are what allows you to play levels, some levels only require 1 or 2 but most require 5 or more. You only have a max of 7 and they take an hour to regenerate so you beat one level and now you have to wait all day to beat another when they only take a minute or two to beat. The gem system is a little weird to, most games that have a system like this will change the amount of gems based on the time remaining. For instance you could start at 1 hour and need 50 gems to finish it now or wait and when you get to 3 minutes you might only need 5 gems. Not this game. If your time is an hour and it costs 50 gems it will still cost 50 gems when you literally only have 1 second left. \n\nEdit: I‚Äôm getting towards the end of the game and I do like that they put in some events every couple of days that help progress the game and give you something to do. But it the late game each level takes 7 chalices which means you can maybe beat 1 or 2 levels a day unless you use gems.

The game does offer instant completion features, however you will have to purchase a pack to get unlimited raid tickets to do so or earn them each day in game. I have paid $1.99 to get these unlocked and that is all. Otherwise the progression is reasonable. The graphics are pretty and funny. The characters are very cartoonishly designed but still nice. I do recommend giving it a try to at least level 50 before you decide. I think the $1.99 was at least worth it to speed up grinding that would otherwise take several minutes. The basics are to gather heroes and later on titans to farm items and resources to level up further and summon more playable characters. Team synergy is very important especially in arena areas where it is on auto. I have 20+ heroes and while I do primarily use the base team I received when first starting the game, I also try to split resources to make well balanced alternates for further progression. One thing I do like about this game is the fact it shows you who needs something, where to get it, and takes you there with one click.

        "message": "Don‚Äôt let the easy on-boarding fool you; this game is 100% pay-to-win, especially once you start getting into the guild/arena stuff. To the devs credit, they have created a lot of different game mechanics, but the underlying game design is centered on making you believe that you are getting a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù when you spend $15 on a skin that ‚Äúnormally‚Äù costs $75 or when you pay 5000 emeralds (their currency, 5k is about $30 irl) to upgrade a character rather than wait. Skins are almost required in the late game as they give your character an added stat bonus. The more skins a character has, the more stat bonuses.\n\nWhat tipped the scale for me was their recent event where, if you completed a bunch of quests in a 3-day span, you could get cool prizes. In the past, a seasoned, diligent player could complete enough quests to get some or all of the top rewards. In this case, one of the top rewards was a skin for my favorite character as well as my top DPS character. However, the only way to complete the quest was to spend 55,000 emeralds, which roughly equates to spending $200 irl.\n\nIf you want to spend hundreds of dollars on a small high, then this game is for you. Otherwise, you‚Äôd be better off spending your money elsewhere.",

I will keep playing and try to keep spending down. The skins are great for a bonus to hero but too expensive in my opinion and for a free player , 5000 skin stone cost for just one skin unlock is way too much!\nThank you for the events and for making a great game!\nI just wanted to update my previous post and drop my review from 5 stars to 3 because I have been billed incorrect amounts for I game purchases 4 different times!!!

Would I be better off passing on mobile games all together and buying a new console with several games?  I‚Äôd save money that way!  I was lured into this game by the puzzle ads and became quickly consumed by the desire to be competitive with the guild and then server and then cross server battles.  Hundreds spent and I‚Äôm still a small fish. The developers set it up to give minimal energy which is the driving force of the game.  Without it you sit and wait until you have 6-24 to start a mission which will give a random reward when you are after a very particular item.  The odds are against you at every turn forcing you to quit or spend another $20-$60-$100 to remain relevant or progress a little bit.  The higher lvl you are the more resources/energy will be required, which ultimately = money, money,money.  \nIf the developers of these games found a way to make money grow from trees!

The principal difference between this game and other turn based strategy RPG is that this one has less story and less involvement once the battle begins.\n\n All the work you do really is done before battle starts. Afterwards, it‚Äôs largely up to the type of team you built, their power, and their synergy. It works well for me due to the fact that I have a number of kids. I have lost many battles in other games because I was in battle and a kids wakes up or calls out suddenly. My kids come first as they should which often results in some kind of loss when I am play PVP real time or some other time/response intensive moment in in the game. I use the auto button even when I am free just to see how my team performs without direct management of their abilities.",

I‚Äôm only 5 months in but basically almost done with my arbriter quest line barely touching nightmare CB boss but as far as what else to do in the game I feel there‚Äôs really not much more to do.. lots of limits as to what you can do and especially for someone like my self that actually pays for things in game I feel we need more.. I know this is a game based off RNG but we do deserve more in my opinion. This game has all the aspects of being one of the greatest game via phone and via computer.. has all the right ingredients just missing something. Hoping moving towards I‚Äôm not one of these people that have been playing since launch that are complaining a lot now... I listed what my complaints are and overall the game gets a 4 I want to bump it up to a 5 but once the added ingredients have been added I will push it up to that none the less.

I‚Äôm always am finding new strategies, which keeps the game fresh. One thing that has always kept me coming back to this game is the clan boss. In my opinion the clan boss is one of the best aspects of the game. Having a boss that your whole clan can fight was an amazing idea. I think it would be great if they added more ways for clan mates to interact/work together. If I had to complain about something, it would probably be artifact upgrades. This has been improved upon in a recent update (where they now allow you to do auto upgrades), but I feel it‚Äôs not quite there yet. Upgrading is based off rng, which I think is fine. The bad part is when you are upgrading artifacts to higher levels. There have been many times when I spend millions of silver on upgrading artifacts when I shouldn‚Äôt have. I think that the player should have a higher chance for a successful upgrade the longer they go without one. This would reset after every successful upgrade.

And if you weren‚Äôt penalized for losing it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal-but you are. So the arena is pointless for me.

That makes no sense, and is deceptive when battling other teams. \nThe pay to play aspect is rather annoying but I get it. \nHowever the fact that you have to pay money to unequip a piece of armour from a champion I s absolutely ridiculous.

Overall it is a very fun game and pretty balanced. I would recommend everyone to give it a shot.  There is one really big flaw that I find though and it is with obtaining jewelry artifacts. For example.  If you need let‚Äôs say an amulet for a high elf faction character.  It is already a pretty low chance that you get an amulet. Then it‚Äôs a much lower chance that the amulet you get is for the 1 out of 16 factions that you need. To put this in perspective. I have been farming the spider for over a month everyday and still haven‚Äôt gotten the any amulets for the high elf faction.  In addition I know people who have been farming it for 3 months to no avail. I feel like a great solution to this would be to make the spider drops similar to that of the mastery scrolls. Where the piece of jewelry that drops will be for one of the faction characters you use to defeat the boss.  This would change your odds of the right faction from 1/16 to 1/5. I believe this would still keep it a grind to get the jewelry you need but it would at least make it obtainable so that you don‚Äôt spend 3 months grinding for something and still never get it.",

The bigger issue is that the lower level heroes (blues) are level capped so they hit 30 and that‚Äôs it unless you sacrifice other heroes to level them up but even blues are so rare that at this point I can‚Äôt level them up. So you get a point in the campaign where your party is capped out at their max level and you can‚Äôt get passed the mission because you can‚Äôt level up any further and get stronger. This is ridiculous in my mind and forces you to buy stuff with real money.\n\nAdditionally the game punishes you by making you spend your silver when experimenting with different gear combos which is RIDICULOUS. If I want to remove gear from a hero I have equipped you need to spend silver which take some of the fun out of seeing how some gear teams up with other and really figuring out how to maximize your party‚Äôs efficiency.  \n\nTo summarize, great game but unless you spend real money you will reach a point where you cannot level up your heroes any further and your progression willl be SIGNIFICANTLY slowed.

I‚Äôm sure I could dig through the forums to try and find answers but I have a job. Also don‚Äôt bother buying shards because you will need to buy dozens of shards to get maybe one good character.

Upgrading armor costs silver. Upgrading is by chance. The higher the armor level, the lower the chance and higher the cost. It could cost anywhere from 5-10 million per armor to get it to max 16 level. \nYou can finish the storyline in 2-3 weeks depending on the time you put into it. After that it‚Äôs just about arena and getting stronger to beat some stages that drop artifacts to make you stronger(lol)\nLike I said. A pretty game.",

        "message": "I really wanted to like this game but there are some fundamental flaws that prevented me from really enjoying the game. \nFirst and probably the biggest issue is the amount of energy required to accomplish anything is extremely high. In the beginning that may not seem like too big of an issue but later it starts to really hinder the progress. The way that artifacts are distributed in dungeons combined with low drop rates and high energy requirements make it virtually impossible to get decent artifacts. Unless you are willing to spend gems for energy refills. However, there is no efficient way of replenishing gems except for buying them. The same issues is with every event and tournament in the game. Unless you pay there is no chance of completing events which prevents you from getting rewards that actually matter. Then there is the absence of new content in the game. The only new thing that is being added is more champions. The only thing that is accomplished by that is that it successfully lowers your chance of ever getting a good legendary champion. Every issue that the game has can be fixed by paying money but isn‚Äôt that the issue in its own?\nThe game has a great potential but, sadly, it seems that the developers are only interested in what‚Äôs in our pockets. All in all a good pay to win game. However, with little content there is nothing to win either. Shallow.",

The game is very fun, especially when you get to read stories that different people made, not just the stories that come with Episode. I also like how Episode stories come out frequently, which is nice. One problem I have is, though, is that the option to create a story inside the actual app is gone once I saved a few stories in Episode Interactive. I want the option back because it‚Äôs a lot easier to create stories inside the actual app. Of course, there are many restrictions that wouldn‚Äôt actually be there if I were to create a story on Episode Interactive, but I enjoy making simple stories on the app. So, if there‚Äôs a way to get the option back, then please respond. One thing that irritates me is that you only get one gem for each episode of a story that you complete. This bothers me because unless you buy a million gems, you‚Äôre basically blowing off all of the gems that it took you so long to get within one choice. Sometimes at the beginning of an Episode story, it‚Äôll already give you a 30 gem choice, when you only have two gems! I think that you should get at least two gems an episode, or lower the prices of options because it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous how many gems you Harv to pay just to make one choice that might not even affect the story all that much. Other than that, the game is really fun, and I spend a lot of time on it.",

And I need to watch so many ads and get so many passes for that! I feel like there should be at least 2 diamonds given. Or maybe a limit to these prices of these choices to all of the diamond choices. If not, I pity you. And problem number two. The Creating Process. So, I‚Äôm the game, you can make some stories. But, why would you limit the process choices to add in your story while in mobile? That‚Äôs just way to much work to actually make a GOOD JUICY story on mobile.

And if you are apart of LGBTQ+ they do have stories like that as well! And they also have stories that take place in Highschool/ college. And stories with mystical creatures and so much more. They have all sorts of  genres to choose from so I‚Äôm sure whatever you like to read will be on there. It is more of a romance based app though but not all stories have that happy ending. If you‚Äôre deciding to get this app I would 100% recommend it and even if you feel like you‚Äôre not into that type of stuff. Just down load it and see how you feel.

Sometimes, it can get frustrating to not have passes when you‚Äôre reallyinto reading the story, but you can watch ads to reduce time, or you can get so many after reading a certain amount. They also give so many passes after a couple of hours. I normally rate an app, based on how much they keep my interest, as well as their support/customer service.

For example, Protect Me (Always) had not a SINGLE choice that didn‚Äôt cost gems. Also, I think the rewards for reading an entire story should be more than 1 gem. Finishing a story should be at least three or four gems. I appreciated how in the Demi Lovato story you could earn gems in the actual gameplay, which made it much more appealing to me. Also, many of the stories have inappropriate material, and a majority of users are children, but I do appreciate the addition of warnings  about content. I have seen many reviews about passes, but that doesn‚Äôt bother me too much, but maybe as time goes on, you can earn more than 4 passes as added incentive to continue playing. That being said, there are definitely some perks to episode. I think that many of the stories are beautifully written and they compel me to keep reading. Most of them portray real life problems and issues but I still feel they are captivating. I definitely appreciate how most of the stories if not all are LGBTQ plus friendly. Also I think the aspect of designing your own character‚Äôs appearance and deciding a name is super fun and useful, end it lets the reader feel in control, as well as doesn‚Äôt give the opportunity to discriminate between races or anything.

That‚Äôs an hours extra wait time. Players shouldn‚Äôt have to use all four passes in order to reset the timer to earn more. It should be an hour or even half an hour for each pass with the option to watch ads (limited number per day) in order to earn more.

With inventory being so precious I'd like to be able to use the full five I have bought or won and not have the game lose them, or whatever is happening to my inventory.

I‚Äôve voted for some pretty amazing designs during judging that I‚Äôm sure also scored lower than the so called ‚ÄúTop Designs‚Äù that use little imagination by going monochromatic or use whatever style the player wishes rather than follow the style description given.

However, I saw someone else suggest earning diamonds for extra voting, which I agree would be an excellent way to incentivize more. Trading unused/unwanted items in would be great! Also once you hit a criteria level (plants, art, table stuff) you should get to use that unlimited, you already earned it. I also read how people don‚Äôt use the criteria mentioned in the description and the designs all end up being only neutral colors and monotonous. I suggest being more aggressive with item requirements, such as more color item requirements per design, and mix them up so that people can learn color theory while they play. I am so tired of voting for only black or white furnishings...I want to see more COLOR please!!! One last item...more challenges-more often, with higher rewards, one suggestion would be if a design wins 4.0 or higher and they use an element in their design that uses diamonds, then they earn those diamonds as a reward. \n\nBut overall, I FREAKING LOVE this game!!!

I need diamonds to buy art and plants over and over again, because they really make the room. And I can't afford to spend the amount of money I'd like to on furniture because not only can I not afford to buy diamonds, and they took the earn free diamonds option off, when you buy them they don't give you a very large amount so it really doesn't last long. I also feel the score after voting should round up if you get a score of 3.7 or higher because there have been so many times I've gotten a score of 3.99 and not gotten the prize which is so annoying. But overall, love the concept of the game. Just wish it could be a little more fun by letting me create the kinds of rooms I'd like to create.",

        "message": "I really do love this game! I enjoy doing the designs, and I‚Äôm always eagerly waiting my score for each design. I do however agree with many people‚Äôs responses around the expense required to buy accessories and wall art.  I wish that if I bought an item, it was always my item and I didn‚Äôt have to continue repurchasing. My husband actually chastised me for the vast amount of money I have spent on this game.  I also agree that the voting does not always seem accurate and that the criteria is not listed when someone is voting so the design may not reflect the desire of the customer and instead it‚Äôs just based on what the designer wants to  design.  I have changed the way I play because I recognize that I will not be judged on the client criteria, but on the general appeal.  As I am voting, it seems that the two designs I am choosing between are very similar in style/quality/score. Therefore, the great designs are put together, and the designs that aren‚Äôt as good are put together. That would mean that some designs that should probably receive five stars do not because they were put up against others who are also very good.  Finally, I really wish there was a way to earn more diamonds. It would be great if after you have achieved 75 keys, you could keep voting in order to receive diamonds. Great way to inspire people to vote and incentivize those of us who would like to earn diamonds more quickly.",

One other person complained of items disappearing, I believe that‚Äôs happened to me also.  I‚Äôve completed offers or gotten through the first couple of questions and honestly could not answer truthfully on the surveys because ‚ÄúMy answer‚Äù wasn‚Äôt a choice.  No diamonds rewarded.  Actually ordered from Black Cobra, one of your sponsors for diamonds and haven‚Äôt received the item (from them) or an update.   I also had to send several support msgs for diamonds not received.  Most offers require a purchase which is not really an FREE offer.  I‚Äôve purchased diamonds to make a room look nice only to receive below 4 stars.  On top of that the prizes are, for the most part, unusable for the challenges.  Too many requirements and items that look way too similar that can‚Äôt be substituted.  Will not spend anymore money on this game.  It was fun initially, but aggravating now.  Items cost too much whether game cash or diamonds and some people spend real cash.

I've been playing for months and haven't lost interest, that being said there's a few things I wish were different; first off I wish it was easier to earn cash I've put some of my own real money into the game and it's gone so quick but takes so long to add back up, second thing i think it'd be so fun to have mirrors available for wall decor the pictures and stuff sometimes just look weird but going without the decor looks weird too! Third thing is that I tend to find a few things frustrating the first being with the new update it takes HOURS to get your voting results, the second being the prizes often are things you can't use for a long period of time-I love the sectionals but they're not required often! The last thing is more of a personal preference more than anything I love when there are outdoor spaces to do I wish they were more frequent! I also really think it would be fun if you could choose more than just furniture in the rooms maybe do a series where you're in control of the paint and flooring too!  in all I love the game and don't see myself quitting it anytime soon!\n\nThis is an edit and I‚Äôd love the suggest the idea of being able SELL our unwanted stuff back! I have dozens of chairs i hate and won as prizes but I‚Äôll never use i think it would be great to sell them or trade them in for something else and have to pay the difference kind of thing!",

        "message": "Really love playing this game. Just a bit of constructive criticism of the ‚Äútop‚Äù designs..., first of all, these designs use repetitive wall art (expensive) and actually not realistic to apply, imho. Secondly the wall, table art and rugs are so important that it makes you want to buy diamonds just to compete which is fair motivation for in app purchases. But I do find it interesting that these over-designed and frankly cluttered spaces are top designs. I rarely vote for them or can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve been asked to. As well, the ‚Äúrequirements‚Äù and their expense to obtain a design at all, rarely looks better than what I can do with my own inventory! I realize that is the challenge aspect and additionally some of the bigger spenders do merit respect. Looking at the cost to compete where 99$ of diamonds is appealing- it is too much for me to seriously consider- maybe when I‚Äôm retired I‚Äôll work it into my plans.  In real time, I will say that I have played the app daily and enjoyed playing and shopping and honing my design eyes. I have realized how much I can do with my own furniture. I even think I have been inspired to make beautiful changes to my own home too! Thanks for the entertainment and education. I have always used magazines as my go to or hgtv- this app adds a new dimension in a fun and interactive way. I will likely play it as long as I can. Thank you!",

I‚Äôm talking everybody, and as a matter of fact, there are so many cards that are similar to one another but differ by just a little just so that you can find some comfortability. A way I would show this is with skeletons, goblins, and guards as they each vary in strength from the least to greatest but each costing 1,2, and 3 elixer respectively. Another one like the mortar is something to cycle, but the X-bow is more agro. And all 98 cards are so unique to where there isn‚Äôt a meta where one card power creeps the other. \nWhat‚Äôs better is that no other game does this, but it has appealed to every person in the audience just yet. There are some cards I would like to see, other cards that other people want to see, and some changes that are requested. This is why this game is still being worked on. If Supercell could find some way to work in the Boom Cannon from Boom Beach into the game or anything similar to where it could 3 shot a golem, that would be insane. Thing is, if everyone still isn‚Äôt satisfied, then the game need more work. This is how one gets closer to a perfect game, and we‚Äôve got to be close to it by now.",

It really bothers me that I can play the normal modes and enjoy the game win or loss, but the second I have to participate in the extra games or tourneys, I want to throw my phone due to stupid decisions on game types or rules they put in. (Also, for those who say, ‚Äújust don‚Äôt play those game modes‚Äù that is where a bulk of rewards I mentioned as positives earlier come from almost exclusively). I say this as someone who‚Äôs favorite game type is a draft battle, where all cards are random chance. Also, why they haven‚Äôt made draft or 2x draft a mainstay outside of the clan wars irritates me as well. All in all, I was loving every aspect of the game until the most recent update where I feel that Supercell took a huge step backward.

However even though they have improved much about it, it still has some key issues that hinders the game from being even more enjoyable. The main thing that has always bothered me is getting matched up again players that are higher level; even though they may be in the same arena, playing against players at a higher level automatically puts you at a disadvantage. Facing an opponent that is only one lever high is not too bad but countless times I‚Äôve went against people who were 2 or 3 levels higher than me. So they have a higher hp for their towers and usually higher level cards, so that has always bothered me since that affects the outcome to many battles. \nThe second thing that bothers me is in 2v2 battles when your teammate leaves halfway, you‚Äôre guaranteed to lose. There is no way you could win against 2 players. I know there‚Äôs practically no way to prevent people from leaving but if there was some type of penalty for rage quitting and leaving a teammate stranded I feel that would be appropriate. That‚Äôs just one suggestion to improve that aspect. \nOverall there‚Äôs a reason why I‚Äôve been playing for so long.

I‚Äôve played a while and have still never gotten cards I could have received at lower levels. I guess that alone keeps some of the interest down. I like that if I really want to get a certain character in clash of clans there is a very clear process that I can work to get that character and improve them. With Royal I can request cards from people in my clan to upgrade faster but I still may not get a cards I haven‚Äôt received yet and have no way to change that.\n\nI do like games that are a little unpredictable and use chance but it‚Äôs frustrating that on my end I can‚Äôt do anything to get certain cards I‚Äôve always wanted.

It just became this pay to win type of game, and gems were super hard to get. Just recently, I got back into it and played enough to get to Arena 8. The newer troops are cool, but they just don‚Äôt seem as unique anymore. Also, gems are still hard to get, and when you do get them, it‚Äôs only like 5 gems. Now, I must say, the update in April that makes sure we don‚Äôt drop arenas is my favorite update. I‚Äôm so happy now because I don‚Äôt have to worry about losing too much. I can just play, and yeah I may lose trophies, but I still get to stay in my arena. So that‚Äôs great, especially for players who aren‚Äôt the best at the game. Another suggestion of mine is to not make chests more expensive as you advance in arenas. It‚Äôs unfair considering the fact that the only way to get a large quantity of gems is to pay. One last thing, and it‚Äôs not necessarily for the game, but for the players. I think you guys should have a contest for a new troop that players get to create. Maybe have a hashtag that allows players to create a troop, and the most likes gets their troop added? I think it would help greatly with the lack of uniqueness in newer troops.

So far most of my cards are level 8 and 9, and everybody I face is level 10-11 with level 11 and higher cards. I find it nearly impossible to win certain games due to the fact that my cards are not good, rather than me not being good. For a while I didnt mind it much until I noticed his card would destroy mine and mine would hardly scratch his despite using the same minion or wizard. Despite loving to play this game, the only fun I can have is in the tournaments where all the cards are put at the same level, that way I stand a fighting chance. I hate playing normally, because I lose much more than I win and I usually have to play much smarter than the other person to beat them because my cards are too weak. I am very upset because I feel like I am forced to pay money to keep up with other ppl. Instead of being rewarded for being good at the game, I am stuck and upset having to spend $5 to make sure my cards are just level 9. I really wish Clash Royale would add an average deck level.

The game has a rating on cards that relate to their power level (common,epic, and rare) but then legendary cards come around and you think wow let me see if I can get one from a chest, after two months of opening chest of all kinds not once did I get a legendary so then checked online and saw that you have to buy these cards with gems or lots and lots of gold. This in itself made question the time I‚Äôve spent playing arena trying my hardest to get wins to get more cards but when the duel was between you and someone with a legendary card you new you were done for . Legendary cards are so powerful in this game that they flip the second they spawn like the dragon that cost 4 mana and can do 1000 damage per second which obliterates your tank minions or the ice wizard which can slow down everything moving. The fact that these minions are behind a paywall just makes the game harder for free2play players, some people might say go and save gems and gold then but the thing is that they are so scarce that by the time you get the gems and gold to get one card , you might as well just turn to another game.

Another thing people complain about is the balance, saying cards are op, and that everyone plays the same op cards. Those are called win conditions. They do the main damage. They are not over powered, they are just your main damage dealer. Ice spirit is not weak because it can‚Äôt destroy a tower. It wasn‚Äôt meant for that. Balloon isn‚Äôt overpowered because it deals damage to your tower. You just have to build your deck to defend it. So many people complain about cards being op, but they just want to win more, and since only 1/2 of the people can win in a match, you just have to git gud. There‚Äôs no way that more than 50% of people can win if everyone payed a single match.

It is a business and they take your money, and give nothing back..except, a little pleasure in winning. however. They turn winning on and off.  For me it‚Äôs mostly off. How can they keep taking my money like that, and not give anything back?  Example Mystical Mermaid.  The bonus feature uses a treasure chest on the first reel..  but it vanishes from off the first reel.  So, How can you get a bonus when the key symbol you need to win is missing?  I bought $600 million chips. In one turn it jumped me to 1.1 billion. From then on, It was down down hill continuously from there.  No jackpots, no wins, just took and took and took. Bet 1 mil, win 200k, which means I lost 800k.. bet bet bet, lose lose lose, bet, 1 mil, win 200k lost 800k..  constantly lose down..  the only time you win, is right after you buy chips.  For a couple minutes.  Then they turn off the winning.  I even though to buy my chip jar.  Lose lose lose.  So be warned..  They turn on winning, they turn off winning.  It is not random. It is not regulated like a real casino.   The fun for me is winning.  Not playing, but winning.  I want to win, this game should try to give something back, instead of taking all the time. 1 billion dollars lost..piece of crap",

It‚Äôs really irritating that you don‚Äôt care to listen to the complaints about your tokens being way overpriced. At least if you have a reasonable sale price then some of us feel we are getting some value for a dollar. \nTruly love the games on this app however it is one of the most expensive apps to purchase tokens to play with. For example it cost $7.99 for 1 million tokens but on most of the popular casino apps it cost $4.99 for 20 million tokens. That is quite a big difference, not to mention you have a better chance of winning at a tribal casino then you do playing on this app. These are some of the funnest games I just wish there payouts were more attainable; after all it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre playing for real money. Lastly I find it very generous of them to give daily tokens on their Facebook page  however; if they really wanted to make it convenient for us these free tokens should have been available on the app itself.",

Also they have different challenges where if you buy coins you can win nice size bonus coins\nI would have to agree with many others on these reviews where for not winning anything other then having fun the machines are way way to tough to hit.

Especially considering the times we are living in and not working I‚Äôm sure many people are playing and spending money that I or most folks shouldn‚Äôt be not knowing how long we will be out of work for. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if the developer and management would think of this and loosen up the payouts. To me quite honestly it‚Äôs shameful what they are doing.

I thought these games were for enjoyment?? They obviously aren‚Äôt to people who keep forking out money to play these machines as I have. It‚Äôs quite unfair.

Sadly, as with HOV, in the beginning it gives you lots of coins and bonuses and you almost can't lose on the spins. Once you establish a pattern of playing, the honeymoon is over and you are stuck waiting for your hourly bonus, or buying coins to play (and believe me, I have).  I know Product Madness is in business to make money, but they could at least set the reels to let you win ONCE in a while.  The bonuses drop to nothing and you are lucky to get a handful of spins out of them.  So be patient--if you don't play for several days and collect your little bonus every 15 min. (if you have nothing else to do), you can save up enough coins to play for maybe 10 min.  I think they hire only techno geeks who have psychology degrees to create the pattern of the games.\n\nIn response to developer:  keep your bull to yourself.  Your canned and syrupy responses are ridiculous.  Your games are a ripoff and that's the bottom line.  People spend good money to buy coins to play your games and you minimize and disregard their doing so with your stupid defense of the fact that you set the games against people.

        "message": "First of all since switching to iPhone I can‚Äôt log in with Facebook and that‚Äôs been irritating. However, this is how it‚Äôs been for both my fianc√© and I both, at first this was the best poker game on the play store and the App Store. More recently it‚Äôs become more biased towards the buyers of chip packages, card packages etc. long story short as long as you spend money on the game you‚Äôre destined to win, otherwise you‚Äôre gonna lose everything. They‚Äôll let you win when you first make an account then you‚Äôll over time lose chips and lose chips until you finally give in to buying and they‚Äôll let you win some just to make you feel good about it. My biggest issue and complaint is I‚Äôve had plenty of encounters with this huge flaw. It caters to the buyers and more frequent players, for example I‚Äôve had a hand say 3 of a kind and win 90k out of a 800k pot and someone with a pair of 5‚Äôs takes the rest. That one happens all too often and that one really gets under my skin. This game is very biased and I can‚Äôt stand it. It‚Äôs not so much of a poker game as much as it is a randomized virtual lottery game with a poker twist to it at this point. Except you don‚Äôt win any actual money back they just take from you. Otherwise it‚Äôs still probably the best one on both app stores as far as gameplay aside front zynga, which is also very arcade like. I suggest poker stars on your PC or the app stores honestly haha",

The game isn't poker anymore,  it is who can  or is able to raise high enough to win, no skill, just keep raising!!!  It boils down to EAPoker wanting purchases of chips!!!   Sad!  I continue to play but with much fustration!!    The clubs are horrid!!!   I take my chips and play and win to advance in rank,  however I can't alwAys play due to work, so you keep taking me back to lower ranks!!   Take me back to level one of that particular suit but not all suits!!  I earned it with money spent only to take it away!!   Absurd!!!   I do appreciate the free chips,  the specials etc...I truly hope you read and absorb this writing...hope to hear from you.   Cheryl M                    I still believe wsop has gotten out of hand, but I limit my spending and just feel sorry for the ppl that can't!     Wsop could lessen the cost and still come out ahead!!!",

        "message": "I‚Äôve tried all the popular poker apps and yes, this one is better than the others... but u still have the issues of extensive algorithm programming that interfere with fair gameplay. For example, they give new players ‚Äúlucky‚Äù river cards to win n such. I noticed around lvls 30, 50, n 80 that my ‚Äúbeginners luck‚Äù was adjusted down a lil each time. N finally at around lvl 130 it must have been turned completely off. I went thru over 300million chips in almost 2weeks of play where I literally lost all but 15 hands played. It was then that I stopped playing for quite awhile.\nI started playing again to play with my friends. At this point I‚Äôve played well over 40k+ hands now. Another irritating example of algorithm manipulation has been is how I‚Äôll pay the blinds and play the hand only to lose, over n over again, hand after hand. Then wen u fold on crap cards (pre-flop), u suddenly realize u folded a winning hand. U would have won either thru making a low pair or by getting the 4 precise cards u would‚Äôve needed. With a ratio of 100 (played n lost) to 3 (folded n would‚Äôve won), if horribly obvious that things r being manipulated to encourage u to purchase chips. \nBut, even with these flaws, I would recommend this poker app because, all the other apps I‚Äôve tried ‚Äúcheat‚Äù u out of ur chips way more bluntly n don‚Äôt seem as secure against hackers as WSOP. Also, they do give u plenty of ways to get free chips.",

        "message": "This is the best poker game out there and it is near perfect I just have a few things that I think could make this truly great.  First, I would like some type of free roll tournament every week or month where people could enter for free and maybe earn some bit of real money.  Second, I think it would also be nice if there was just a little bit more time to make a decision with hands unless I have missed something.  Finally, it would be cool to have leagues of some sort both public and private where people could play like a season or something along those lines. Now to hit on a point that a lot of people bring up in their reviews about having to pay money.  Depends on how good you are in all honesty and how well you understand poker and how the people who make games make money.  If you aren‚Äôt good and you want the games bracelets/rings you are either going to have to be good and earn them the real way or pay lots of money.  Poker is a game where 80% or more of people that play never turn a profit it would be stupid not to capitalize on this as a developer and they also have to make money to give us a great game.  Like I said truly a great game just a lot of people not understanding how things work in their reviews.",

        "message": "Great overall game play. App works with the only glitch I could tell is for some reason after two or three games if I lost it would gray out and I would have to force close the app to get functionality back.  Weird but not major.   Now...I do not believe the card play is random by any stretch of the imagination. We all have bad luck streaks. Not complaining about that but the creative ways you can lose is ridiculous.  The number of games you can lose in a row is crazy. At one point I lost 25 or so games in a row.  Again, could be bad luck.  But then you look at it overall and there does seem to be a pattern. One of which is you go on long losing streaks where you never or barely win.  Then the next thing you know you‚Äôre winning 2 of three games for days.   Okay, let‚Äôs chalk that up to luck. How about when during play when someone gets down to their lay chips/hand, the number of times they win is staggering. It‚Äôs gotta be 90% or higher wins for them, me included.  My strategy ended up being (1) never bet when there was someone on their last legs betting, they were gonna win and (2) if I was on my last legs I knew I was gonna win regardless of what I had.  Again, worked about 90% of the time in my estimation.  Got tired of the swings and last stand winners so I deleted.  Not a sore loser. Had worked my way up to $17m by playing $300k games to win $1.5m.  Even through streaks was able to maintain a decent amount of chips.",

        "message": "Like playing poker, not when it‚Äôs rigged like this and don‚Äôt tell me that‚Äôs how the cards are dealt. Players with large amounts of money playing against me who has pennies. I get to play with the 62,000 chips I get as a gift. Always get crap dealt to me, never high card pairs, just 2-3-4 etc. Others get high cards dealt to them and also pairs. Spin the wheel and never hit anything big. I have a good hand, ALWAYS get beat out by some one else with a better hand, after they have won 2 or 3 times ina row. When I accumulate around 5 million chips, lose that fast because I have to play with a crappy hand, and others with a huge amount of chips, clean me out, with great hands. On occasion I‚Äôll get a pair of aces dealt to me and that‚Äôs it, nothing to add to it, but that how the cards are dealt. I think I‚Äôll go play, I have bout 5 million chips, but that will go fast to some who can outbid with a better hand. Sooo rigged. I love this game when you play with people who have so many chips I get cleaned it seconds after of course I get dealt crap. I love this game when you never hit the big mega bonus, only a few hundred thousand chips. I love this game when I‚Äôm told that is the way the cards are dealt, while I watch others with always great hands dealt to them and win consecutive times. I love this game when I feel I have and always get beat by someone with millions of chips and a better hand. That‚Äôs why I live this rigged game",

Bad beat after bad beat after bad beat.  The game constantly beats me by giving my opponent runner runner to win.  I can have a pair or a flush draw and bam I will lose.  Just listen to the comments made by other players and you will see what I am saying is true.  If you tell me that the cards are dealt randomly, I will tell you that is bull pucky.  There is no way I can lose hand after hand when I have the best hand on the flop and then again you give my opponent runner runner and I lose, this is just ridiculous guys.  I have played in casinos all over the U.S and I have seen a bad beat here and there, but this site gives them to players that don‚Äôt buy chips and rewards those that buy chips, instead of being truly random when you deal the cards. Shame shame!!!!!  I gave in and played $50. 00 in real money and it seemed like I was being punished for doing so!  I would get great hands and then someone would insta call after the flop and get runner runner to beat me hand after hand.  Wow really.  You say hands are randomly dealt, I say you select who wins and who loses.  Again listen to the various quotes from folks who experience the same horrible beats like me and then you will understand why folks are either leaving your site or seldom playing on your site at all.",

The same person does not win 10 times in a row with a table of 8; we were all frustrated. Please don‚Äôt send me a message with how you site is certified. It is a joke, what are the statistics of me getting a 9 2 off suit 4 out of 10 hands? 52 cards; 4 nines; 4 twos; and 4 out of 10 times. You are morons, I try to have fun and play the odds and lose to your stupid algorithm. My suggestion is fix your algorithm like many have posted here and quit think that you developed something good. Once again; morons! If I could give this app no stars that would be too many. Additionally, there have been many reports against players that are just as bad as the developers; what do you do about them? Back again with another review, this time played a tournament and got 10 5 off suit about 3 out of ten hands. The same odds as getting K Q but I didn‚Äôt get that and as a matter of fact I did not win a single hand out of approximately 20+ hands. Not sure if the developers are paying attention but that is probably why you can‚Äôt get the algorithm correct. Back again with the same problem, I had 9 10 back-to-back a few times and not terrible cards but really. I have lost 20 million fake chips these past few weeks mostly because people do not know how to play poker but also this crappy algorithm that these morons developed.",

If you play real poker you know that these kind of hands don‚Äôt really happen very often in hold em. It‚Äôs mostly a game of pairs. But not here! Enjoy the thrill of seeing wildly unlikely hold em combinations on every hand. You even get some yourself. This happens all the time in the tournaments, not sure about regular play. Fun game though. Buuut really annoying at times. Now I see what people meant by it‚Äôs not random. Card distribution is probably random. But the flop and river cards... def not random. There‚Äôs absolutely no way. Not saying it cheats for any particular player. But it is certainly designed to create ‚Äúexciting‚Äù finishes based on the cards that are already in players hands. Have never and will never spend real money on this game based on those beliefs. Perhaps tweak the deal card object/method to have this ‚Äúexciting finish‚Äù kick in when there are only 2 players left. Aesthetics are siiick though.

        "message": "WSOP is always fun, no question. Got hooked playing online back about 15-years a go when it was first on AOL (and tourney winners actually won a trip and buy-in to the real WSOP in Las Vegas). This app certainly works great like you‚Äôd want and expect for the brand, and keeps you entertained for sure. The real problem with it though, and unlike other game apps I‚Äôve used, it nearly requires you to not only make in-app purchases, but to do so consistently....and they are not cheap for what you get. For example, $15 gets you about $75 Million in chips. Only enough to play 5 entries in the bottom level of the special tourneys they have....but along with that every pot you win they deduct 15% locking it away in your ‚Äúpiggy bank‚Äù which you have to pay to break and get your chips back. Basically theft in-app. So without putting more money in constantly you cannot keep playing the weekly games/tourneys as 99% of users will eventually run their chips dry. The same $15 that eventually runs dry on this app will get you several decent apps in the store, so not a great app for this reason alone. The value is simply lacking long term.  Chips should be cheaper and much easier to earn in quantity to still take part in the weekly fun, even for those on a budget.",
